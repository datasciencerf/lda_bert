"It was Me not the Mattress. I went through a lot of mattresses over a number of years, convinced modern mattresses are all crap. My lower back pain always seemed to come back. 

Turns out I have something called chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) which up to 15% of men 30-50 develop. It is a bizarre problem that doctors don't totally know how to fix, or how it even starts. If you are a male and have mystery lower back pain that comes and goes almost randomly, consider looking this up. Part of the problem is that it expresses itself sometimes through back pain but it isn't even a back problem - which is why a neurologist told me nothing was wrong with my back (making me confident it was my mattresses). It's actually your prostate and the muscles around it (pelvic floor). Who would expect you need to talk to a urologist before someone knows why your back hurts in bed? I wanted to share this because it's apparently very common yet I've never heard of it. Millions of men have it"
"TIL about Purple mattresses.... Holy balls....

We had a budget of 5K and spent about a month testing out a whole bunch of different mattresses at various stores.

If you have a Sleep Sherpa store near you, you can try out nearly all the online beds in that one store & order from there too- same price & everything. They're pretty cool. Anyways-

We bought a Purple Hybrid (Purple 2) because my husband likes a firmer mattress and is a stomach/side sleeper while I'm a strict side sleeper & prefer something squishier. We tested out the Purples & the Purple 2 seemed fine. We went with Mattress Firm for the free haul away.

Ummmm, did y'all know the Purple 2 is definitely NOT recommended for side sleepers? Because I did not know this for the last 32 days of shoulder and neck agony. Not regular bed break-in pain, but like severe jammed it in a sports accident pain. So I reached out to the Purple chat group to see what I might be doing wrong & that's when they told me that each of the Purple beds had a sleep position recommendation.

I was unaware.

The lady at MF was also unaware. 

But she was extremely nice & even gave us a retroactive credit when I went in to do the return today. They had a Purple 3 in stock and it's getting delivered tomorrow (per the chat guy's recommendation) & I'll give it a proper break in period too but I'm hoping the intense pain subsides. 

So TL;DR- the Purple levels aren't just luxury, TIL they equate to firmness and are for sleeper positions as well. Oh, and the cooling effect is legit. No sweats at all."
"Just received my new Tempur-Pedic LUXEbreeze soft!. About five years ago I ordered a basic king size mattress from Bed-in-a-Box. I read reviews and they were all glowing! Like a fool, I trusted every word. I now know most of those are sponsored reviews and outright fabrications.

For the past five years I’ve had upper and lower back pain, skin issues from the extreme heat, constant tossing and turning, etc. I slept like a rotisserie chicken. If I shot for eight hours of sleep, I would get probably six. I just figured I sucked at sleeping.

I finally got fed up. I couldn’t take it anymore. So last week I started really researching mattresses. I spent a lot of time here in this sub, specifically, to learn more about mattresses and to avoid disinformation.

I decided to pull the trigger on a king size LUXEbreeze Soft. After all, we all spend a third of our lives on a mattress. I just received it two days ago. In those two nights I have slept better than I have in years. I wake up without pain and I haven’t woken up with the sheets sticking to me due to sweat. I’m thrilled and my girlfriend is too!

The guy at Mattress Firm threw in two TEMPUR-Cloud pillows for free. Those have been a marked improvement over my shredded memory foam and bamboo pillows. I ended up paying around $5400 *after* tax, delivery, and the pillows. What a deal!

Edit: does anyone use a cotton mattress pad or moisture barrier on their LUXEbreeze, or does that make the cooling less effective?

Thanks, everyone, for being a wealth of information! Now, time to sleep."
I work for Mattress Firm in operations in a very large market. AMA (Honest answer only). 
"I don't like the Purple 2.... Been sleeping on it for over a month now and it's horrible.  My entire body is sore and strangely enough, also my calves! My neck is the worst. Been sleeping with those thermacare neck wraps for the last few nights which have improved my neck pain quite a bit temporarily. We are sending this mattress back and getting a Stearns and Foster. After revisiting the store and telling the salesman about our experience he admitted that the purple mattresses are the worst. Wish the original salesperson would have told us that before selling us the Purple 2!"

"Tempur Pedic Cloud on Sale - worth it?. I've seen a lot of conversation about Tempur Pedic in here, but don't see a lot on the new Tempur Cloud (tempur pedic's bed in box).

"Purple Hybrid Vs Premier. HI Guys, so Ive been a original purple user for about 2 years now and love it. However I'm moving to a bigger place and want to upgrade from a queen to king. My question is what is the difference if any between the hybrid and the premier. Besides the 800 dollar difference there seems to be very little if any difference. Is there something I'm missing. The price isn't a factor beyond I hate paying for the sucker model of anything. Any help would be great thanks."
"Sciatic pain - is my Purple mattress the cause ?. Very doubtful I know but just wondering.  The first week on the Purple 4 was great but now the past 2 weeks my sciatic pain has been getting worse.

I did have sciatic pain back in early January that went away by the time I got my Purple.  So I'm sure it didnt cause it but is it possibly contributing to it becoming worse?   It's the worst it's ever been.   As in I can barely walk ."

"Beauty Rest Black Ice Mattress, sinking problem after only 3-4 months?. Below are photos

So long story short, last year around October/November.  I bought a new bed cause of severe back pain.   After days/hours of bed shopping I was stuck on the Black Ice or the Luxe Breeze.   After trying both for a couple hours in store I went with the Black Ice.   It was an amazing mattress, over night my back pain was gone, not an exaggeration.  Well the pain has been coming back slowly and I have been noticing more and more the middle of my bed feels different.   I know mattresses have a break in period, but I ordered a firm mattress and this is beyond soft now.   The sides seem to still have a lot of support but when I sleep on those I definitely feel like I am sleeping on a slope.  Honestly almost feels like my old mattress slope now.

I am 6'3 215-220 lbs.   I am tall and Lanky not big.  Anyhow I decided yesterday to get something straight and take a look.   Can you guys look at the images below and let me know what you think?  Where my hips sit seems to be the only part of the bed where the bar separates from the mattress.   Does this look like sag and should I contact warranty or do you think I may be shit out of luck?   

Head - https://imgur.com/9u0xSy9

Hips (separation may need to zoom in, edit man this is blurry may need to retake)- https://imgur.com/qlmzK3B

others - https://imgur.com/fFMbTTj, https://imgur.com/uu4eV4U

This is seriously disappointing after only 3-5 months or so.

Edit:  Spoke to Mattress Firm.   I am outside the 120 days but they are going to let me do it anyways.   Under the same financing, with all paid amounts credited.   250 dollar restocking free though but that is a small additional price to pay realistically.  

Payment is going to jump from 60 to 100 a month but mofo ill do it.   Any tips for the luxebreeze?

edit 2:  So finanacing didn't work the way I was told on the phone so when ahead and paid the additional cost out of pocket.   Not money I was looking to spend but hey ill pay for comfort.   That said after retrying to tempurpedic line again I ended up with the proadapt medium hybrid over the Luxebreeze.  Also this better be the best mattress ever created because I got rear-ended on the way to mattress firm and they totaled the back of my car."
Should I get rid of my mattress?. I’ve been sleeping on my mattress that I bought 5 days ago and been waking up with a lot of lower back pain every single morning. I feel that the mattress is too hard and quite different from when I tried it at the shop ( I guess the display piece had time to settle at the shop since it was way softer than mine). I read that mattresses take a long time to settle and for your body to get used to sleeping on them. I just don’t know if I should keep trying and stay patient or just buy a softer one. I’m a 33M and the store does not have a return policy.
"1-year Temporary Queen recommendations that do not sleep hot. Here’s the scoop, I have a 3 year old Zinus Green Tea, super comfortable but it is so hot that I cannot do another MO summer on it. 

Specs: 

one human under 200lbs, one human under 125.

Side and stomach sleepers. Hot hot hot sleepers in the summer. 

Planning to move states in approximately 12 months and will be upgrading to a King with our next house and this bed will be regulated to our 2nd guest room. 


I am looking for a mattress to use for a maximum of 2 years that won’t make sweaty as heck all summer. 

I’m leaning towards the Zinus cooling hybrid icoil 12” for $322 delivered. 


Any personal recommendations under $400?


**yes I’m willing to pay $400 to not sweat this summer!**"
"Adjustable base?. My wife and I recently purchased a split king bed with encased coils; the manufacturer told us the models we chose would work with an adjustable base.  We are interested in purchasing an adjustable base as I snore and my wife would like the ability to raise my head to potentially reduce my snoring.  We have held off purchasing an adjustable base thus far because i have no experience with them and haven't and am skeptical that they are as useful as they are billed to be.

Does anyone have experience with them?  Do they help with snoring?  If they are helpful there any models you would recommend?"

"Purple mattress?. So, I'm thinking about getting a purple mattress, or maybe a purple hybrid 2. I'm mostly a back sleeper, but go on my side on occassion, and was wondering if purple mattresses are really worth it? And what is their financing like, is there any big down payments to be made? I am literally currently sleeping in a recliner because I've tried many kinds of beds and haven't liked them, so who knows, purple may be my savior. Any people have it and love theirs? Or anyone have bad experiences with them?"
"Original Purple mattress problems. I have had an original purple mattress for about 3 years now. After the 1st year, I started experiencing  lower back pain when I woke in the morning, which intensified over the second year. I realized this bed was a problem when my wife and I switched to her old firm spring mattress, which eliminated the skeletal pain over a few weeks. 

My current issue is that the bed causes pressure-point pain and my arms to fall asleep if I lay on my side or chest. Does anyone have a recommendation for a topper that will help alleviate this problem? I can't really afford an expensive mattress at the moment."
"Switching from memory foam to coil, or no? And, help with choices? Aireloom vs. Tempurpedic?. I was wondering if anyone has experienced switching from a memory foam mattress over a few years back to a more traditional spring and coil mattress? Did you find it took a bit to get used to it again, or did it feel less supportive?   


My husband and I have had a really cheap split king foam set up for a few years. We really like the split king set up because I wake up super easily from motion transfer, although I don't think ours were really great mattresses and frames to be used as a split king, as it slid apart too much.   


However, I have a pretty bad back and migraine issue, I wake up in severe pain once a week that I have been having regular injections and PT and medication management for, but it's quite debilitating, so we want to go all in for a new mattress.   


We are thinking of spending perhaps a tops of $5k, and though these two brands are quite different, we are pretty torn between Aireloom and Tempurpedic.   


I honestly love staying in hotels or AirBnBs with real gushy pillow tops or plush traditional mattresses, so though I haven't owned one in many years, I am thinking of making the switch back, and going the Aireloom route. I really liked the Oakmont model and Raymour and Flanigan, but am also going to check out the Folsom and Beryl in plush at Bloomingdales.   


However, I feel more secure going with a Tempurpedic for some reason. I feel like they are really made to work as split-kings since that is how they showcase and it says so on their website. I also think they are just such a well-reputed company that I have more trust for them. The short of it is, I think I'd really like to switch back to a gushy coil mattress, but I am nervous that they won't be as substantial or work as well as a split king, and possibly that it will hurt my back more over time, so am leaning towards Tempurpedic, which I have long admired as well.   


  
Any thoughts?"
"Mattress guide / Gel mattress / Recommendations UK. Hi all, 

We're looking at buying a new mattress but want to make sure we get the best deal.  We went to our local dreams and liked the therapur actigel bed, it is really expensive though!

Since then I've been looking for some advice.  Would love to read the Which? magazine mattress guide from 2019 but don't want to subscribe just for that (does anyone know how I can access it?)

Other than that, anyone know where I can get good mattress reviews and whether online options are better than a store (I'm nervous about buying without reviews or trying something myself).

Thanks!"
"Outlet Tempur-Pedic Soft Luxe Adapt. I went to a Mattress Firm today and I was heavily interested in a Tempur-Pedic mattress. This mattress retails at $3800. I’m a college student that’s 19 and has had a couple of shoulder surgery’s and one back surgery. The sales person had told me I can get this bed for 60% off ($1400) when she is able to find it as pre owned or a floor display. Tempur-Pedic has a 90 day exchange window, if I’m getting a bed that’s only been used for potentially 3 months at 60% of the cost should I pull the trigger? She also mentioned that they are very strict on their sanitizing policy’s and that I could also pay $100 for a warranty and she would be willing to give me a free base along with it. All I want to know if this sounds like a good deal or some sham."
"Guest Bedroom - Bed in a Box. I am looking to order a queen sized bed in a box for our guest room. This mattress will be used by house guests and occasionally my husband or myself.  We have a toddler and an infant, so if one of us has a big day at work or something where sleep is especially important, that person will sleep in the guest room secluded from the rest of the house.  

We have a soft Tempurpedic in our master bedroom which we LOVE.  I had always thought I liked firm mattresses but the soft Tempur is great for both my husband and I (him, 6' \~170lbs, me, 5'6"" \~115lbs).  I know a bed in a box won't truly compare to a Tempurpedic but based on this information I would love recommendations.  I would say our budget tops out at around $2k. 

I am looking to order soon, my husband is in the middle of an intense time at work and our 3 month old is still waking frequently at night.  

Thank you!"
"Mattress and back pain starting at night. Hey all!

I've always had problems with my back when it comes to sleeping. Almost every morning I wake up and my back is stiff and hurts (specifically my mid-back and lower-back). When I get up and move for about 15 mins, that back-pain is completely gone until the next night. 

Over the years I've tried all kinds of different mattresses, from soft to medium to firm. All seems to give me problems. 

Now I've recently bought a Matt mattress ( [https://www.mattsleeps.com/en](https://www.mattsleeps.com/en) ), which let you change the firmness of the mattress. This, however, also doesnt cut it for me.

I would really appreciate your help!"
"Trying Out Online Brands. Hello!  In the market for a new California King mattress. I have plenty of stores nearby like Steinhaffels, Mattress Firm, Ashley Furniture, Hasselless, and plenty of local stores. 

One problem is given our rather tight (and steep) stairway with a 90 degree bend, probably the best option to get a california king upstairs is with a bed-in-a-box.

However, I absolutely refuse to purchase a mattress without trying it and it looks like it is nearly impossible to try any of the following in most stores: Layla, WinkBeds, Casper, Brooklyn Bedding, Puffy, etc.

I have managed to find a Tuft and Needle at a Lowe's 20 miles away and there are Purple and Nectar at Steinhaffels nearby.

Any suggestions on how to actually find these mattresses for testing?"
"Any reliable adjustable beds that bend close to 80-90 degrees?. I would like to get a queen and keep the budget under $1000 if possible. It's gonna be used for tv watching/gaming quite a bit so the more upright, the better. I found one on amazon that went to almost 80 degrees but didn't seem too reliable.

I am guessing a 10 inch mattress would be needed if it's gonna bend this much?"

Original: Hey guys.  Moving into a new apartment soon.  All the places I’ve lived in prior were condos that came prefurnished, so this will be my first attempt at furnishing my own apartment.

If you could help me narrow down some of my questions I’d appreciate the help.

1) I am moving into a 5th floor walkup.  What would be the most seamless way to purchase and have the mattress delivered?  I assume I will need to buy both mattress and bed frame at the same location for compatibility.  And pay extra for delivery to have the store drop off and carry the mattress up the stairs for me.

2) Upon move-out do what do tenants typically do?  Am I buying a mattress bag and donating or reselling the used mattress locally online, or am I expected to toss it in the garbage or bring it with me?

3) Is there a standard for what people moving into a new home do when waiting for furniture to arrive?  I assume there will be a few days’ time between move-in and coordinating delivery for things like a mattress to arrive.  Do they book a nearby hotel or is it normal to just sleep on the floor for a few days?"
"Validity of Graphite/Graphene Infused Foam. I’ve seen many mattress manufacturers pushing products based on graphite and graphene infused foams. Most say that the foam will act like a heat sink for your body and reduce body temperature. Some say it helps to get the heat to the PCM faster. From the articles I’ve read so far, I’ve been getting mixed information. Some say that the particle’s chains are broken and therefore almost all of their heat transferring properties are gone, but testing has shown slight improvements over foam without it. 

Do you have any experience with these foams? Any idea how well they work in the real world? ??"

"Super tight protector + sheets making mattress seem too firm?. Hello, I just bought a new foam mattress and it's seeming quite a bit firmer than the one I tried in store. I'm wondering if it just requires a good break in period or if perhaps my super tight mattress protector and fitted sheet are just making it seem firmer than it actually is. Is that even a thing?

Side Fabric: Henry Carbon
Base: Stichbond Non-Slip
Zipper: Nylon

Comfort Layer: 2” GOLS Organic Dunlop Latex (20 ILD)
Transition Layer: 3” 2lb High Density BioFoam (23 ILD)
Support Core: 3” 2lb High Density BioFoam (40 ILD)

"After a year or so down the mattress rabbit hole, I bit the bullet on a SleepEZ Hybrid 360 Pillow top.. How did I come to this conclusion?

The FAQ on this site was a godsend as were the folks in this sub. I also researched on the mattress underground and finally, went to some local mattress stores and laid on them. 

We found we preferred having the support of the coil springs and a plush pillow top. We did some Sleep to Live comfort gauge thing which recommended medium to medium firm support (not sure on the validity of the tech, but it's ideally what I wanted anyway).

We also drew off of past experiences. We have an old Beautyrest Thedora pillow top that still holds up pretty well and my daughter uses now. Our mattress previous to the SleepEZ was a POS Oregon Mattress Company innerspring that failed less than 5 years after purchasing it. 

I knew latex would have the comfort and longevity I was looking for as well as a pocket coils for the support like our old Beautyrest. 

Ultimately I settled on SleepEZ because of the budget and the clarity on the materials used. We also got two free pillows. 

Other contenders:
Flexus Comfort 
Arizona Mattress Company 
Mayer Bedding 

I was able to customize our bed with medium talalay pillowtop layers and still have the option of flipping to a firm side if desired. 
SleepEZ also offers a $30 comfort exchange so if we need firmer/softer they'll ship a new layer and you have 30 days to decide which one works for you. 

First impression: It's soft and supportive and I can't wait to go to bed! 

I'll be providing updates every 30 days as I know there's a break in period. After the 90 days I'll come back for an annual update."
"Anything else like Novosbed Firm?. Greetings!  
Currently using Novosbed Firm with Firm Comfort+.  
To be fair, before adding the comfort plus, I did not like the mattress. Didn't find it firm enough and was HOT!!  
The Comfort+ kit corrected those issues and I love it now.  

I have it in Queen, but am looking for another bed in California King for another bedroom.  

I like trying new things. And need a mattress which will support 300lbs/person. I'm 260lbs, GF is 120lbs. She also loves the Novosbed, which to my surprise thought it would be too firm for her, but we both sleep incredible!  

Thought about latex (SleepOnLatex Firm), but it's heavy, and as far as I know not as contouring as foam.  
Interested in OkiOki Firm, seems like a firm mattress which stays cool.  
Would like to stay under $1500cdn for Cal. King.  
If all else fails, I'll just get another Novosbed, and maybe a 2"" latex topper to try out? Or just have the same setup as my Queen which I would be happy to do again.

Any suggestions?

I know no other company uses the purple grid, atleast not one i can find, so is an original purple the closest ill get to the feel of a purple 3 under $1000 for a full?

"Zinus Mattress - Fiberglass?. Hi all. I recently ordered a “Zinus 8 Inch Gel-Infused Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress, Queen”. Whenever I buy anything, I read so many reviews and for this, i’ve become terrified of fiberglass issue. Now, of course I wouldn’t open the mattress cover and now I’ll probably apply like three bed protectors lol. I’m still scared though- would exposure be an issue even like this? It has so many good reviews but at the same time, I know amazon has a lot of fake reviews so i truly don’t know what to do. Fakespot gave it a B. Lol not sure what to do with that information. This is price range since i’m a broke college student just trying to sleep on a bed lol. But still, i’m scared of all these bad reviews - i read somewhere here that fiberglass was a scam made by other competing companies, but i’ve read about actual people complaining . can anyone help me please?"

"Sleigh bed mattress support. I currently have a sleigh bed with a box spring that is probably 10 years old. I see there are new mattress supports. I'm getting a Brooklyn bedding signature mattress and was looking at their mattress supports. But I cant tell if they will work with a sleigh bed or if they are stand alone bed frames.

Id like to keep my sleigh bed, how can I figure out which support works with it. Just meqsuring stuff? Or are there specific ones for sleigh beds?

My sleigh bed frame has 3 long boards that run across and hold the box spring. I think I should be able to remove that if needed."
"Rank this mattress. Outer layer:

- Hybrid Latex OEKO-TEX Standard 100

- 1.2"", 4.4lbs/cf (3cm, 70kg/m3)


Middle layer:

- Memory Viscofoam 

- 1.6"", 3.1lbs/cf (4cm, 50kg/m3)


Base:

- Support foam (polyurethane?)

- 7"", 1.9lbs/cf (18cm, 30kg/m3)


I tried the mattress in a show room and I like how it felt. They advertise it as regulating temperature well due to the latex layer - is a layer that small enough?

I am afraid it will sink in the middle layer due to the low quality memory foam (according to the FAQs here). 

The brand does advertise a 10 year warranty, but I'm skeptic. They claim there needs to be a 1"" long or 1"" deep indentation or bigger, visible without any pressure on the mattress. 

Let me know what you think and what you consider a fair price for an online mattress of this quality, size double. 

Thank you for your time

More info: I'm a side sleeper (sometimes halfway side/belly) currently on a very harsh and old bonnel coil spring mattress. I've been getting some ache from hip and shoulder pressure recently.

I do like a firm mattress though, so as an alternative I'm also considering instead of a new mattress getting a topper online or at Ikea. If you have some suggestions on that matter I'd also greatly appreciate it. I was thinking latex for breathability and durability but I know I don't like latex mattresses (at least Talalay) due to their springy nature. Not sure if a latex topper would change the feeling enough to feel weird. I was also considering wool but I'm afraid it will wear out pretty quick. For a topper I'd be looking at something priced under 150.

Also, I'm expecting to change furniture in 3-5 years so a topper would be a cheaper way to temporarily fix the mattress until I can get a better one with the new furniture size. 

Thanks once again for reading through the wall of text"
"Purple 2?. Long in short I need a new mattress....I tested this in store and seems good. 

In all honesty, I know nothing about mattresses. I've slept on same mattress for 20+years and only now does my back hurt and that mattress cost about $300. 

I am a combo sleeper back, side and stomach depending on day. I weigh about 135lbs if that matters. When I test mattresses in the store they all pretty much feel comfy....i mean i guess i don't know what i need. 

I found myself attracted to the purple because its different and I liked the technology behind it. Curious if anyone has tried the purple and would recommend or not?

The big debate is the price, I mean I could go for another under $500 mattress or even pay a bit more but is it worth it for the purple?"
Looking to buy a new mattress. Too many biased reviews.. As the title states. I don’t know who to trust. I am in the market for a new mattress. Budget is around $1200. Looking for a king mattress for two average weight side sleepers. Any help is much appreciated! Willing to stretch the budget a bit if there is a great deal out there.
Did I get hosed.... Went to mattress firm specifically to try beauty rest black series ended up really liking the Jennings appreciated that it had the black ice foam and the additional mini coils as well as the triple braided heavier gauge coils. The continuation of the Presidents’ Day sale gave us the king for a queen price deal and a free mattress firm head raising only adjustable base. Paid 3999 but yet I’m reading on this sub Reddit that people are paying like 3500 to 3700 for the Jennings. I haven’t taken possession of the mattress yet but I’m starting to wonder if I got hosed any thoughts?
"(Recommend me a bed) I’m going to throw my 2 year old tulo king medium out. I was so excited when I purchased this bed, and after the first week it has been literal hell on earth.  I wake up every morning in pain, I don’t sleep well, no support etc... my wife doesn’t mind it as much but agrees with most of my sentiments.

I’ve set a budget of $5,000 for a bed and base.  That seems to cover me with a few of the “luxury” brands.  Are there any can’t miss options?  Would you guys recommend the folding bases made by manufacturers for the full experience or does it not matter? 

  I was ready to buy a sleep number but a few bad reviews have turned me off.  I hate to say that because you can find a negative internet review on just about anything.   I want to fully educate myself before making this purchase, as I clearly did not do enough research last time.  

Thanks."

"Latex vs. Polyfoam. I've started the incredibly painful process of looking for mattresses without getting scammed in the process.  I went to TMU (The Mattress Underground), studied up, and started by calling retailers and manufacturers in the LA area.

First one I called - Select-A-Bed - was adamant that Polyfoam is more durable than Latex. Now, if you've been to TMU, you'll see that they are pretty much arguing for the opposite.

Went through the FAQ here, and there's no real, clear cut Latex is better statement. I understand it really depends on the density ultimately, but the guy on the phone said that Latex dries up in 10 years, no matter which type.

What are your thoughts? 

Any recommendations re: the quality of Select-A-Bed and Templfow mattresses?

"In the Kirkland Signature S&F a S&F Cassatt?. Hi All,

I've written in another thread about my bed search (I have a Wink that I may send back).  However, as a result of my research, I think I may try the Kirkland Stearns & Foster Lakeridge.  In looking at the specs posted on the Costco site, I wonder if the Lakeridge is a re-badged Cassatt.  The Lakeridge has the same coil count as the Cassatt (2264 for the King and 1744 for the Queen).  Also, the Lakeridge has the ""Intellicoil HD"" as opposed to just the ""Intellicoil"".  So it looks like the Lakeridge would slot in the Estate Lux level of the Stearns & Foster portfolio.  If so, wouldn't it be a good deal?  Another other insight into this bed would also be welcome.  I'm about 260lbs and a combo sleeper.  Thanks!"
"Split King Adjustable Base, mattresses seperating. I purchased no slip pads and they are helping a lot, but I had a stroke of, hopefully, genius and wondered if anyone had tried what I envision.

I want to get L brackets from the hardware store and screw them into the, what feels like, wooden base of the adjustable base on the outsides. I was thinking 1 at the head and 1 and the foot, in the middle or so of the piece for best results. I don't want to get them too tall so you risk sitting on the edge and feeling them, but I want them tall enough to hold the mattress. We have a purple 3 so I was thinking 2-3 inch Ls. 

Anyone have an opinion on this idea. The bases only have a retainer bar at the foot of the bed so the don't slid up and down, but if someone ends up in the crack, they will seperate. The actual bases are heavy enough that they stay in place, just the mattresses are scooting a little."
"Two toppers; latex under memory foam. Good idea?. Hello
First time poster. 
Tried to find another post like this by searching the sub reddit and FAQ but couldn’t find a similar one. 
Sorry if this is a common question. 
———————

I currently have the linen spa 2” memory foam which I put over a firm spring mattress. 
Link:
Linenspa 2 Inch Gel Infused Memory Foam Mattress Topper, Full https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MRL0H2B/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_9ifAEbY1ZSR6P

I notice that on hotter nights I don’t get much support in my lower back, causing a sinking where my lower back is. This causes my back to become more u-shaped instead of n-shaped when I’m laying on my back. 

I recently heard about natural latex being a more “springy”  material. I’m currently considering buying a 2” latex topper to put underneath my current memory foam in hopes that if my lower back area begins to sink that the latex will provide some “springy” support. 

Does anyone have any experience with this? 
Would this be a good idea?
Should I get a 1” latex topper instead of 2”?
Any brand suggestions? Preferably sold on amazon.


Please let me know. Thnx!

TL;DR
I’m considering buying a 2” latex topper to put underneath my 2” foam mattress. Is this a good idea? If not, what would you suggest?

Edit:
Some background info. I weigh 160 pounds and am 5’9”. And looking to buy off of amazon."
"How to fix mattress left on one side for too long?. Not sure where else to post this, but I couldn't find any information on the internet so I thought I'd ask in here. So I moved house recently and as a result my mattress had to be in storage for around a week. Well instead of it being stored flat, it was stored propped up on one side. So now my mattress is super thick on one side because it has a pillowtop and im not sure how to shift it back to normal? Would just sleeping on it even it out or is there any other method?"
"Heated corn cozy on purple mattress?. Sorry if this has been addressed before, but I have a purple 2. My fiance always has cold feet when she goes to bed and uses one of those reuseable corn packs you heat up in a microwave.

Is this a valid concern?  Purples website was vague but said no direct contact for long periods."
"Update for looking for coolest bed in Canada... Silk & Snow Hybrid didn't work out, what next?. I posted earlier about trying to find the coolest bed I could in Canada.  
Got a Silk & Snow Hybrid. Its construction is 1200 pocket coils (King), with 2inch of 3lb memory foam on top, with another 1inch of 1.8lb ""cooling gel foam"", whatever that means.  


The bed is much better than my old memory foam mattress but still heats up. At first its fine but heats up overnight. Comfort wise it is great at first but as it heats up the memory foam sinks in too much making it uncomfortable. I do like the pocket coil feel though.  


I am using it on the floor right now since I don't have my bed frame in yet. But I will wait for it to come in to try properly. But I don't think it will be the one for me and will probably go back.  


Trying to assess my options now, definitely staying away from any memory foam composition.   


1) Purple. Everyone says it stays cool and has a 100 night guarantee. Unfortunately can't get the purple hybrid here so I am stuck with the foam base - I don't like the ""dead feeling"". It's also on the pricier side and require their sheets.  


2) Get a custom made pocket coil + latex (2-3"" of dunlop or talalay) or pocket coil + polyfoam (2-3"" of regular polyfoam) mattress made locally. Not sure how much cooler polyfoam or latex will be against what I am sleeping on now, but I found a few local guys who can make a mattress to my specs for a decent price. Only con is no returns if it doesn't work out.  


3) Get a mattress with no foam at all and all springs. Is this even a possibility anymore? I haven't seen any local stores have this. I used to have an old mattress like this and although it stayed cool, it's not the most comfortable.   


Any other insights? Thank you"
"Shopping during COVID (and new baby). We had a baby last week. Theres a pandemic going on. We're moving out of state May 1 and will be going from queen to king. My wife, understandably, doesn't want to go to a lot of box stores. Normally I'd just say wait it out, but kinda unique circumstances where we need a new bed that day. I've been reading FAQ and what not and have the general jist of shopping. I'm down to try a Tempur-pedic, so willing to go up to that 4-5k range, but don't have to spend it if we dont have to. In 2010 a completely broke us took all our savings and got a Beautyrest Vanderbilt Classic Alder Firm Pillow top. Seems to be working, however it's kinda worn into a 'W' shape, despite us turning it. Not super enthused about only 10 years, but oh well. I prefer softer and my wife firmer but we have agreed that the mattress is a nice middle ground. We do like the motion control. Ill use that as a starting guide, thought I can't find the exact specifics of the mattress to do comparisons.

I am getting a significant pay raise and do believe in the adage of 'dont skimp on the things between you and the ground '- shoes, tires, mattresses. Thanks for your help

"Mattress recommendations please. Hello, I am 24 years old and I weigh about 180 lbs. looking for a mattress recommendation.

I am mainly a side sleeper and occasionally sleeps on my back but I suffer from my lower back pain a lot. I have Sealy west salem mattress (firm) in queen size from Costco for 2 years, and it started giving me lower back pain when I wake up in the morning in the past year. I haven’t been able to sleep in for very long because I usually get woken up with a sore/stiff lower back in the morning or pinch nerve in my hip area during the day.

After a couple research, I decide to give a mattress topper a shot at fixing my lower back problems. Now, I have Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR ProForm Supreme 3-Inch Queen Mattress Topper (memory foam-medium form) on top of my Sealy mattress for about a month, but my back issue is still happening every morning when I wake up. 

Side note: I have been traveling a lot and staying at Airbnb. I stayed at a couple places where their mattress gives me no back pain or pinch nerve at all for weeks. This is why I think my mattress is the issue. I have seen chiropractors on my issues for about 1 year, but I didn’t see much progress.

At this point, I’m very desperate for a mattress to really allow me to have a good night sleep without any pain in the morning. Could you guys please tell me if you have any mattress recommendations for me? Thank you so much!



TLDR; can’t find the right mattress for my back pain as a side sleeper. Please help!"
"Received my mattress almost a month ago, and there was a dry stain on the underside when I unpacked it. Store is offering to exchange for a new one. Is it worth exchanging mattress, over a stain?. Hi everyone, I purchased a mattress from the brick, a stearns & foster cardinal point luxury firm pillowtop. 

I received the mattress on March 7th, took it out of the plastic, installed my mattress protector, and noticed there was a dry stain on the underside. The Brick told me to report any defects within 48 hours after the delivery. I was worried this stain would cause warranty problems down the line.

I contacted customer service where I bought my mattress from. They never picked up my calls, or responded to my emails. I didn't really think much of it after a few days, and posted a google review with my experience 2 weeks later. 

March 29th, they finally replied to my email, telling me this stain will void my warranty, but since I did report it under 48 hours, they will process a exchange for a new one, but with COVID-19, they have to wait till the risk is lifted.

I like the mattress, I sleep well, but is it worth going through the exchange, because of a stain? Would like some input. Thanks, and sorry for the long post.

Edit: I'll go ahead, and make the exchange. Thanks for the communities input!"

"Debating between these 3 mattresses. Any opinions on which of these would be best? I’m about 6’4 290 and I’m a side sleeper. I was originally set on the Costco Stearns model but from what I understand they tend to break down quicker. At the time it was $1200 (now on sale for $950) so I started looking at Costco’s Simply Modern (seems to be a good value for what it is) and the Brooklyn Bedding Titan. These two seem pretty similar to me. Or am I missing something? 

But since the Costco Stearns model just went on sale today for $250 off ($949.99 for a King) I’ve been reconsidering it. The coil count is 2264 whereas the other two are just under 1000. Wouldn’t that alone mean it’s gonna be more supportive? Or am I missing something here as well? 

Any opinions?

There have been ZERO spills on or near this bed, and I’ve been using their water proof bed cover they sell you on when you purchase from them. I’ve never seen anything like this before.

"Mattress Recommendation. Hello,

So my budget mattress I purchased in 2018 is starting to crap out. King sized Serta I purchased from Sears. My wife and I are waking up in pain every morning just like we were with the orevious mattress once we knew it needed to be replaced. Anyway, I am starting to look at online retailers like Purple, Wink, Casper, etc and it's really tough to decide. I also have a hard time trusting ""review"" website because they can easily be paid by bias. 

The other thing I need to factor in is our weight. I see that a normal mattress can support up to 250lbs per side. Back when we purchased this mattress, I was very overwieght, up to my highest in July 2019 at 335 lbs. Since then we have both lost weight and I am currently at 270lbs and she is at 225ish lbs. We plan on continuing losing weight but it is slow going at the moment. I do see mattresses online that are for bigger people, which you seem to pay a premium for. I also think a hybrid memory foam/spring mattress would work better for us this time (I have never liked straight memory foam).

So my big question is just go with a regular mattress considering our weight, cause I don't feel like I'm too far off, but at the same time it may have accelerated the breakdown of our current mattress. You can see where I'm coming from. Pay extra for a plus sized mattress or a more budget friendly regular mattress?

Can anyone make any recommendations for my unique situation? Price depends on what type to financing I can get.

TIA"

•What bed should we be looking for if I plan on buying a latex topper? 

•What latex firmness & thickness do you recommend?"
"Tempur-Pedic mattress delivered semi-frozen. Could walking around on it before it fully thawed have cracked and destroyed the memory foam?. Today, my new Tempurpedic was delivered, hard as a brick (I’ve had a previous TP and know that they are firmer when new, but this was *next-level* hard). After a quick Google, I realized that this is likely due to the fact that the mattress had “frozen” and needs to thaw. However, before making this discovery, I not only laid down on the mattress, but even **walked around on it in** an attempt to soften it up (as I’ve heard  this recommended). However the walk-on-it advice pertains to a *non-frozen* mattress.  

After reading [this comment on this thread, in regard to frozen memory foam](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2opir2/lpt_if_you_get_a_memory_foam_mattress_delivered/cmpdgzp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), I’m now concerned that walking around on the (semi) frozen mattress could have damaged or cracked the memory foam. Do you think the likelihood of this having happened is high enough to return the mattress and request a replacement? I don’t want to get stuck for 10 years with a $3000 broken mattress, after all.  

Important Note:  the mattress, while extremely hard, was not frozen SOLID per se - when I laid on it and walked around on it, it eventually had a bit of depression/give, so perhaps the mattress had already begun to thaw out, lessening the risk of cracking and ruining the memory foam? Also, when I feel around on the bed, it feels contiguous and solid and I can’t feel any discernible cracks or incongruities. Additionally, it is only the top layer of foam that had frozen - the lower layers feel soft and pliable. Do you think I’m safe, or should I maybe consider an exchange?

It drives me crazy that for a $3000 mattress, zero warning is given about this possibility of freezing, nor any guidelines on thawing it out safely. So any tips you might have would be appreciated - thanks!!"

I've had it for about 2 weeks, took a few nights off sleeping on it but am back at it.  I sleep okay on it, if it wasn't;'t for the back stiffness I'd probably call it good.

Is this a common occurrence or should I try for a different firmness?"
"Seeking Medium-Firm Mattress - Mira, OkiOki, Tuft & Needle?. Has anyone tried 1) Mira Bed (same manufacturer as Endy) 2) OkiOki, and/or 3) Tuft & Needle?

I'm looking for a new mattress that is medium-firm, and won't break the bank. If I buy a mattress that sinks after 6 months, I will riot."
"Purple Mattress Trial?. I am a student doing an internship in another state beginning in May until August. I have a mattress at home, however I am unable to drive it across the country to my new apartment, and I will have to store it instead. 

My internship is approx 100 days. Would it be possible for me to simply “trial” a mattress such as the purple, instead of buying a new mattress?

Edit: alternatives are welcome, I understand this would be somewhat unethical... but if I really enjoy the mattress I would be happy to buy it after the trial."
"Side sleeper with hip pressure on every mattress I've tried. Any tips?. I've tried poly foam, pocket coil, memory foam, latex/coil hybrid, memory foam/coil hybrid and everything gives me wicked pressure in the hips and I cannot sleep. Toppers work sometimes but they have always flattened down and become useless after less than 2 months, and never fully relieved the pressure.  What can I do? It feels like I've *never* laid on a surface that doesn't give my hips pressure. I know it's not an injury or anything of that sort, I've been checked by doctors and physio."
Purple hybrid 3 break in?. We just got our purple 3 yesterday. In the store it felt like a cloud. Ours feels like a rock. Just brutally firm. Is there a considerable break in period?

"Be careful buying memory foam mattresses!. So I had this memory foam mattress from Lucid for a few years. They have a fiber glass inner sheet that is supposed to retard flames in case of a fire. Well, they don't tell you that over time that sheet breaks down into itty bitty fibers. When I went to wash my bedding the other day, I noticed that the mattress cover had a label with instructions stating that it was machine washable. So I thought I might as well clean it as I haven't since owning the bed. What a mistake... Within seconds my room was engulfed in fiber glass particles. I've been cleaning for days trying to get this stuff cleaned up. I had to throw away the bed and all my bedding. It scratched up my computer monitors, desk surfaces, and got inside my computers as well. There's always some fiber glass making me itchy now.

I've vacuumed well over 20 times and I'm still finding fiber glass. Been going around with a headlamp since it's the only way you can see all the particles. Fiber glass is even embedded in my curtains, mouse pads, and gaming chairs, and I really don't want to toss all that out too...

So please, if you buy a memory foam mattress, be weary of fiberglass! It will ruin your entire room. This stuff is like herpes.

Also, f\*ck you Lucid for being of no service or help! I'm trying to reach out for some kind of warranty or compensation, but now they are ignoring me. Not only did I have to throw away my bed and nice bedding, but my entire room is now infested with fiberglass."
"[LOOKING FOR ADVICE] Affordable firm mattress that ships to Europe.. **TL;DR:** Am tween male, average size, average weight, like firm beds, sleep on stomach, have [IKEA Morgedal](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/morgedal-foam-mattress-firm-dark-gray-70277392/), it's okay but doesn't work for more than 5 years, wanna spend $500 or less. Am in Europe. Read everything for more insight.

**Introduction:** 

Hey guys. I'm a male dude (duh) in my early twenties, looking for a new mattress. I weigh about **80 kg or 177 lbs at around 180 cm or 5' 11''**. I'll most likely put on some weight 5-10 kg or 10-25 lbs over the next couple of years. Live in Europe, by the way.

For the past couple of years I have slept on an [IKEA Morgedal](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/morgedal-foam-mattress-firm-dark-gray-70277392/) mattress with ""firm"" firmness at **140*200 cm**. I'd say it's quite okay to sleep on. It does kinda cave in after a few years. So it's not exactly flat anymore.

I sleep on my stomach most of the time. Sometimes I am in some half side half stomach position with something (mostly bedsheets) between my knees. Close to never fetal and absolutely never on my back.

**History:**

I have slept in other beds during holidays, relationships and stuff like that. About once or twice a year I go on a trip or festival and sleep in a tent for up to 4 nights. Usually quite soft meadow and a small sleeping bag (plus non slip sleeping pad (foam) for festivals). Legend says I also slept on the floor or on tables before, but there's no way to confirm that. ^(But just in case it's true, it would feel pretty nice for one night)

So far, every bed other than my own felt too soft for me. I have convinced girlfriends to come to my place instead of me going to theirs just because I get back pain in their beds. That's how much it bothers me. To be honest, my back really likes sleeping in a tent, but I'm not sure for how long since I haven't done it for more than 4 days before.

I don't really have bad back pain. But it definitely is something that exists in my life.

Recently I have been tested for allergies because I do get lung problems for months on end. Turns out I have really strong reactions to spring and especially summer pollen. But even more problematic, house dust, meaning *dust mites*.

**What I need:**

Doc told me to get a **new mattress** even if the old one still feels good because of the stuff that's trapped in there. I should then put the mattress in some microbial cover, but that's been dealt with already. 

Since I need a new mattress anyway, why not find the right one for me? Right?

Well, the internet tells me that these things cost upwards of 1000 bucks most of the time. I don't think I'm willing to spend that right now, sadly. So much about budget.

Now, like I said, **stomach sleeper** with light tendencies to side sleeping.

I like the feeling of a **firm bed** in my experience. So I'm guessing I wanna buy one that's as firm as the firm [IKEA Morgedal](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/morgedal-foam-mattress-firm-dark-gray-70277392/) or harder.

I have no real experience with different kinds of mattresses. A gf did have some box spring bed, but it was simply too soft for my liking. Other than that I have no idea what I'm sleeping on, but similar to the box spring bed it's usually too soft, so I can't judge it outside of that anyway.

Other than that, I'd also be really happy if the thing could **hold up for 10 years** or even more. But I don't know if that's possible at **around 500 bucks**.

I really hope some folks here are able to help me find an appropriate mattress, that satisfies my needs."
"Which Brand to Buy??. Tulo vs. Casper vs. Nectar vs. OkiOki

Which is the best quality and most comfortable. I’m a stomach sleeper, 5’6, 165 lbs. Looking to buy new mattress for when I move into my new apartment but I am torn between these brands. They all seem to be good options. Thanks in advance!"
"Any suggestions for Hybrid Mattress?. Hello,

I'm looking into buying a hybrid mattress and have been reading a ton of online reviews.  Not sure how legit some of these online reviews are so if yall have any personal experience with any hybrid mattress that would be great. I'm a combo, stomach & side sleeper. 


Two options I'm looking at are
1) Bear Hybrid <--- leaning towards this
2) Capser Hybrid

Does anybody know the quality of the two mattresses i listed? 

Thanks!"
After much research. I’ve chosen to buy a BigFig Mattress. It came in yesterday and was set up today. My wife is convinced it’s so much higher than our previous mattress. But I’m trying to explain to her that our old mattress was just sunken in. I am 350lb 5’10” and wife is 5’ 250lb and I’ve been enjoying the mix of comfort and firmness so far(about an hours worth). I’ve eliminated 3 king size pillows I used to sleep on. I’ll update you all if things change. I think this was the best decision I’ve made so far. Fingers crossed.
I need a new mattress but im worried about pissing my money away again. I ha e a $600 two year old mattress that is crap and I need to replace it. I loved it for the first year or so but now it's already sinking. I obviously want to replace it but I'm scared that i will spend even more money (which I don't have a ton of) but still ending up hating it after a year when I can't get a refund.
"Latex recommendations?. I’ve decided on either a latex or latex hybrid because I sleep hot and dislike the memory foam feel. I am a stomach and side sleeper but very thin and prefer something softer, I’m thinking a 5/10. 

I’ve narrowed it down to a few companies and was wondering if anyone else had gone latex recently and which you went with? Here’s my finalists so far:

Dreamfoambedding/Brooklyn, ecoterra, mygreenmattress, wink, avocado"
"Good mattress for all 4 main sleeping positions? (back, front, either side), my last premium was way too firm (ex picked it out now she is gone, yay!). Most of my younger life, probably through age 20, I was a front sleeper or stomach sleep, whatever it is called. I even have the crease in between my eyes to prove it. 

Somehow, some way, I evolved into being a side and back sleeper. I suspect because it is far easier to snuggle with a partner on your back or side than it is on your stomach -- but that is just my theory. 

I've now been a back and side sleeper for so long, that my back actually gets a bit sore if I try to sleep on my stomach on a mattress that isn't super firm -- but I feel like I sleep more soundly and deeply on my stomach -- and I recently saw a medical video that our lungs work better when we sleep lay our stomachs... so I'd like to get back to that. 

However, I've also found that if I try to sleep on my side on a super firm mattress -- that it kills my hips -- even if I have a nice body pillow. It also hurts to try and sleep on my back on a super firm mattress. Now, I suppose I should try a super plush 3"" topper to cushion some of that but then I think I'd be back to it hurting when I try to sleep on my stomach. 

Does anybody else deal with this? What was your solution? 

My last premium mattress was very expensive and very firm (my ex picked it out, but she is now gone, yay!). 

So I'm in the market for a new one.

I was most recently making due with a firm futon mattress that had a 2.5"" pillow topper -- but it is time to get something better I think and I just threw away that setup when I moved (the futon was starting to get mold on the bottom even though it was on a well ventilated slatted bed frame)."

"What's wrong with highly rated/cheap Amazon mattresses?. Hi all, been doing some research and can't help but feel that some of these cheap Amazon mattresses are a really good value. I spent some time on Sleep Like the Dead but when I look at the cheap mattresses all they really have are Zinus/Best Price but don't include several of the other apparently decent looking brands. We've been sleeping on a ""[sleep signature](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A4OP8Y)"" hybrid mattress for 5+ years now (springs are finally poking through, but quite the value imo) and in general we're ready for a king.

One mattress that seemed decent was [Vibe](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074NDRJX4)'s 12 inches mattress at a paltry $250. It has high reviews, 2"" gel memory foam, and 3"" ""gel comfort foam"".

Why would I spend 3x the price for a different brand? Amazon's going to let me return the ""vibe"" if I hate it, I just don't understand where the extra $$ are going with more expensive brands. Nothing is quantifiable regarding density, etc so all I have to go on are the word of the brands. Why not take a flier on Vibe? If it only lasts me 3 years, that seems like a pretty solid value no?"
"Will a mattress topper ACTUALLY help with my sunken mattress?. So my mattress has bad sinking issues and recently it's been getting worse and I've been getting zero sleep. I've read that a mattress topper can help with the problem until I can afford a new mattress. If toppers are helpful for this issue, what are some reliable yet affordable brands? Dont really wanna spend much over 100 to be honest. Also I've got a queen as well. Also do toppers make things hotter? Cause i tend to sweat a lot at night and as it is barely get sleep during the summer because of the heat. So toppers that stst cool or have cooling would be ideal."
I've had the same mattress for 12 years. I've had my twin size mattress since I was 3. I'm about 6ft tall and I have no idea if my mattress is uncomfortable or not. I'll put an image [here](http://imgur.com/a/yDs5Cnf). While reading this I kinda slid or threw my self onto the bed and it felt like someone punched me in the gut.
"Mattress review bloggers / Youtubers. Can any of these provide any value? They are all obviously getting some kind of kickback since they all have disclaimers about it and discount codes.  They all never say anything too bad about any mattress. I feel like these reviews are pretty worthless if they have an agreement with the manufacturers. They are all experts on something that is mostly subjective. Useless. Utterly useless. 

I’ve come full circle in thinking the stores were overpriced pushing junk and these bed in a box companies were superior but now I’m starting to think the bed in a box are all the same crap with slight differences and the stores with inner spring are probably more legit. 

I’m considering abandoning my search due to being frustrated with the industry as a whole. I might just thrown some blankets on the ground and be done with it. 

??"
"Mastresses sinking in??. So about a year ago my mattress started sinking in, and formed a giant crease in the middle of my bed.

What kind of mattress would yall suggest?"

We are torn between:

 \-Nectar mattress (for the price), but it seems like it might not be great for someone who runs hot and is heavier.

\-Brooklyn Bedding Aurora (because of the cooling), but it is at the top of our budget.

\-Or finding a tempurpedic or purple mattress on craigslist, then replacing it in a couple of months when we can go out and try mattresses, if we don't like it. This only concerns me because I don't know if a craigslist item has been exposed to COVID or bedbugs. 

Please help! Any and all advice welcome."
"Help - I want to stick with a Purple mattress. Hi guys, long time lurker but I really could use some advice!

About 2 months ago, my wife and I purchased the Purple 3 Hybrid Premier. We tried all kinds of mattresses and took a very long time before landing on this particular one. It really won us over with how comfortable it was in the 2 showrooms we visited over the winter, and nothing else really wowed us. We just kept going back to it, and eventually bit the bullet and ordered it from Mattress Firm, and it was delivered shortly after.

I love, LOVE this mattress. I have never slept on anything so comfortable. I am a 5'7"" and 160 lbs man, strictly a side-sleeper and I sleep hot. I wake up with no aches or pains at all since having this bed, and even had to switch from a thin knit blanket to a comforter since it keeps me so cool!

My wife, on the other hand, was crazy about it for about 2 weeks - she is 5'5"" and about 30 lbs heavier than me, a combo sleeper who had mild shoulder, rib, and hip pain with our last mattress (firm memory foam) before switching to Purple. 

After those initial 2 weeks, most of her pains completely disappeared, but the hip pain grew worse and worse. We tried everything; we got her new pillows, added a knee pillow and a pillow between her ankles, she's tried to stay asleep on her back, but nothing works. At least now it's just her hips and no other pains, but it's bad enough pain that she can't sleep through the night anymore.

She's been beating around the bush whenever I ask her if it could be the mattress, and I think she was sparing my feelings and waiting it out because she knows I am ride or die for this mattress. Well, finally this morning she said she thinks the mattress isn't working out for her. I was dreading hearing it, but her sleeping experience is just as important as mine so that's that.

So now we don't know what exactly to do, and I'd be heartbroken to go back to a non-Purple mattress now, but I recognize it's a good possibility I'll have to. Mattress Firm gave us a 120 night trial, and we are well within that, but of course it isn't open and we wouldn't chance it if they were (we live in New York). I'm a hardcore fan of Purple now and I really don't want to give it back, but back it must go. 

Perhaps going up to the Purple 4 would help her awful hip pain...does anyone have a similar experience or advice they can share? She has wider hips than I do, so I'm sure she is sinking in more than I would...but would 1"" more of the Purple grid really help? You can definitely tell the difference between all the models in store, but we have to think long-term.

Finally, if I absolutely HAVE to leave Purple, does anyone have any other suggestions? Man I am not happy about this, but I can't let my poor wife suffer...

TL;DR: I love my Purple 3, but it's exacerbating wife's hip pain, wondering if Purple 4 would be better for her, if not then what might?"
"Having trouble finding mattress for my wife and I. I’m 6’4”, 240 LBS and sleep primarily on my side or stomach. My wife is 5’7”, 140 Lbs and sleeps on her back. I would say our budget is around $1500 and we have a king. Any help is apprecoated"
"Need advice on a new mattress. I’m 5’2, 130 pounds. I’m pretty exclusively a side sleeper and I run very hot at night. 
I currently have a memory foam mattress and it is taking a toll on my hips and shoulders, also I stay hot at night even with the air on 68 and a fan blowing in my face. 

I’m looking for anything that would be better on my hips and shoulders, I can sacrifice some of the cool factor if I won’t be in pain haha. Budget is about $800, but I can be flexible. 

Any suggestions? I made a mistake with the bed I have now and I’d like to avoid making another mistake."
"Really Terrible First Night on a Brooklyn Signature -- Problem or Not?. Hi, everyone. This is my first time posting in this group. I really respect the opinions and expertise of people here, so I thought I'd reach out for some advice.  

I have chronic low-back and hip pain, and for the past month it's also affected my mid-back and neck. My old mattress, a Sealy Posturepedic pillowtop, had sunken in so badly that the only piece you could really sleep on was a ""plateau"" in the middle. I spent a ton of time researching mattresses and finally decided on the Brooklyn Bedding Signature Hybrid in medium firmness after reading a lot of good reviews from back-pain sufferers. I chose medium because I wanted a blend of softness (I'm a side sleeper) and support (for my back and hips). I'm used to being sore when I go to bed, while I sleep, and when I wake up, so I know I'm probably hyperaware of any discomfort.

Anyway, last night was my first night on the new mattress. I know the first night is not the ultimate test of whether a mattress will be a good fit, but I was in a very considerable amount of pain the entire night and probably only slept an hour or so. It felt like I was sleeping on a board, and I couldn't get comfortable no matter how hard I tried. Everything hurt: ankles, knees, hips, back, shoulders, neck. As someone who's used to aching, this was much worse than usual. The company's policy is to give it 30 days before determining that the mattress is too firm, but the idea of 30 terrible nights like this fills me with dread. Should I just tough it out? Add a mattress topper so it's a little softer? I'm wondering if I should just have bought the softer-firmness version (but was afraid that would put me right back in saggy mattress territory in a few years).

Has anyone had an issue like this, and did it eventually resolve itself? How long does it take for a mattress to be broken in, so to speak, and what exactly does that mean, in your experience? 

Thank you for any advice or answers to my admittedly panicked questions -- I'm trying to be realistic about first-night expectations here, but I also don't want to be ignoring a red flag. I appreciate your help."

I do tend to sleep pretty hot. I ordered a Titan, but after looking at reviews, I am concerned that it may be a little too firm, especially if I plan to lose a fair amount of weight.

"Is a latex mattress the best for a hot sleeper?. Based on everything I've read so far, latex seems to be the best for not absorbing heat.

There are 9 different companies in the question title. I'm rather doubtful that each of these companies had a stroke of ingenuity and created 9 new and unique products.

Are all these foam mattress companies the same? Is there really a difference? How would one go about choosing among these manufacturers (or maybe *re-sellers* is the better term).

"Replacing my mattress today, what compares to the 2010 Tempur Pedic Cloud Supreme (2010) ?. Hi, I am planning on buying a new TempurPedic mattress today, to replace our old Cloud Supreme 2010 queen.  I am going to be buying a king size mattress, and was looking at the Luxe Breeze.  I realize that they are pricey, but I am looking at the softness and he cooling features.  

A couple questions.  I will be buying the tempur pedic mattress protector.  The one I bought 10 years ago was almost like a latex, but protected the mattress well, until we removed it one day to clean it, and the cat decided to go to the bathroom on the bed...  Would the mattress protector take away from the cooling features of the bed?

2. I know the mattress is thick, so should I buy Tempur Pedic brand sheets?  Are the fitted for the steeper, thicker 13"" mattresses?

I don’t know anyone at Hamuq; I do not have any financial interest in Hamuq; this is a completely independent review.  I think it’s important to state that, as many review sites appear to be owned or sponsored by a mattress company.

Only one 1-month so far, and I’ll plan to come back with a 90-day and 1-year update.  Buying a mattress is a grueling decision for a person like me, endlessly googling reviews, wanting to get the best value.  I’m hoping this review will is a public service announcement to help others.

People sleeping in this bed:

* Male, 220lb, 6’3”, 80% side sleeper / 20% back.
* My wife is less than half my weight, a foot shorter than me, 100% side sleeper

Old bed:

* Sealy Beautyrest, queen size, the bowling ball mattress.
* A great bed, but \~13 years old.  I wasn’t terribly happy with the mattress purchasing process, as we had the mattress exchanged 3 or 4 times due to defects (each new mattress was a different type).  Some mattress showed up with tears in the seam or indented heavily towards the center of the bed.  Therefore I am not loyal to any mattress stores and with COVID and a 100-day return policy I thought I would try a box mattress.
* The old Beautyrest was a  Medium firm.  Very good at no motion transfer. Still comfortable feeling to this day, but a few seems are blown out and the sides are bowing out.

Selection Process:

* I wanted a mattress with springs.  All foam mattresses make me nervous -- how can it be as good? -- and worry about depressions that stay in place.  That narrowed it down to Logan & Cove and Hamuq.  From a few reviews out there, Hamuq sounded like it might be a bit stronger and a bit more firm.
* “Canadian Steel” is nice, but doesn’t mean a lot of you don’t know the wire gauge vs. other mattresses.
* 100 day return policy is good.  No risk.  I heard they might not return the mattress if there are stains, so I bought the mattress protector to ensure this couldn’t happen to me.

Hamuq Order:

* May 13 ordered.  May 25 delivered.  Toronto, Ontario (?) to Edmonton, Alberta.
* Ordered everything because we’re going up a bed size:
   * King sized Hamuq.
   * King size pillow
   * King size duvet
   * King size sheets  (didn’t show up, yet)
   * King size mattress protector
* The sheets didn’t show up.  Left a voice message, then went online and talked to someone live on their website that same day.  They were “backed ordered and are going to send out to me on a priority basis”.  Sheets showed up after 3-weeks.  I wish Hamuq notified me of this prior, as I was at Ikea (after a 1.5 hour wait) the day prior, and would have bought extra sheets if I had known.  We moved up from a queen to a king, so we needed new everything.
* I bought the mattress protector after an online review mentioned Hamuq wouldn’t take back their mattress because it was stained.  Plus I would have got one eventually anyway.
* Check your gmail SPAM folder.  Half of my correspondence (the receipts of order and other notifications went there).

The mattress delivery, unboxing, and first sleep:

* Doorstep delivery was no problem.  I received a notification email earlier that day.
* The king-size mattress is incredibly heavy.  I’m fairly strong but had a difficult time moving this upstairs.  Mainly because of the awkward size, and the hand holes in the box ripped when I tried to wrestle it upstairs.  My wife guided the front of the box while I pushed from below.  \*\*\*I definitely recommend 2 people if you need to go upstairs.\*\*\*
* Unboxing was easy and the mattress quickly unravels and takes shape within minutes.  I messaged Hamuq about how long I needed to wait before sleeping on.  I assumed it would need a few days, but it looked good and they confirmed I could sleep on it the same day, but the mattress would need a few weeks to be fully uncompressed.  I think Hamuq should include a sheet with instructions perhaps.
* Very minimal off-gassing.  So little that I wanted to sleep on it the first night, and we did.
* **\*\*\* That night I had the best sleep!!! \*\*\***
* Before, most mornings I would wake up a bit sore in my lower back and sometimes shoulders. I have attributed this to tight hamstrings and my weekend warrior / office worker lifestyle and getting a bit older (40 years old).  However, I realize now, my old bed was the problem.  I haven’t experienced this eureka moment before though, despite using other beds while on vacation or visiting family.
* I don’t think I notice the effect of cooling gel, but it seems the same as my old bed for temperature.  We also bought a new duvet from Costco, so it’s tough to tell.  Too many variables changing at once for this.  But it’s fine or the same as before.  I do feel like the bed is a bit cooler once we put it on our BJÖRKSNÄS IKEA bedframe.  The first 5 nights it was directly on the floor.
* The mattress is definitely a medium firm, which I love.  If you like soft mattresses, this isn’t the one for you… however, I would still probably buy it and get a mattress topper.  Most nights when I get in I feel its a bit firm, but it seems like it cradles my body just right so that I have pressure spots.  I’m not sure if that’s memory foam or the springs, but they figured it out.  I have started sleeping more on my back again.
* Appears to have strong edge support.  While I don’t need to sleep near the edge anymore (yay for King size), it does hold up well if I go near the edge and when I get out of bed.

Duvet Cover:

* The duvet cover is beyond soft.  Like, call in the entire family to take turns petting it.
* When we unboxed it, it did have small little white flakes, which looked like possibly from the manufacturing process.  Perhaps the serger sewing machine leaves a little bit.  Just shook it outside and washed it.  Not a problem.
* The Duvet cover always looks fresh on the bed.  You can’t tell if it’s been freshly washed or used for a week and sat crumpled up on the floor all morning.  Nice Zipper too.

Bed Sheets:

* Feels like the same material as the Duvet cover.
* My wife says it’s really soft and she loves them.  I think they are probably comparable to a high thread count sheet from Costco, but they do fit the bed perfectly.

Pillow:

* We only bought one.  I can’t review until I try it a bit more.  I am more of a memory foam with a neck support type guy, so I’m not sure I will be reviewing the pillow at all.  It is well built and I tried last night for 80% of my sleep.

Mattress cover:

* Covers the bed and definitely feels like a quality protector.  Probably water-resistant or waterproof.
* There is a tiny hole in one corner that I noticed after we washed the cover after 2 weeks of using it.  It appears to be a manufacturing defect where the topper material slightly ran out, but the stitching is still really good and strong.  I might contact them, but will likely just take it to a tailor after the 100 days.  Or do nothing, I don’t think the hole will get any bigger.

Pros/Cons

* Amazing mattress: feels great, quality is top-notch (stitching, good edge support, etc.)
* Great, quick customer service via the webchat or email ([info@hamuq.com](mailto:info@hamuq.com)).
* The duvet cover is incredibly soft.  It also always look fresh (no wrinkles).
* Sheets look great, are soft, and fit perfectly.
* No motion transfer between sleepers
* Medium-firm mattress.  Perfect for me.
* Sheets were not included in the original shipment.  It would have been nice to have known prior to shipment of the mattress.
* Not sure if I’ll like the pillow.  It is good, but I am more of a memory foam with neck support kind of guy.  I’ll keep it because it will look good when I make the bed.
* I wish there was some instructions as to when we can use the mattress.  Turns out it’s right away, although it might take a few weeks to reach its final form.

Follow-up:

* I’ll try to respond to all questions below.  Or feel free to PM me.
* Because of the high quality of everything, I will be saving up for a Hamuq duvet one day.  I’ll review that if/when I buy one.  I need to let the credit card cool off a bit first.
* I haven’t bothered taking any pictures, because the mattress does look just as good as it does on the website."
"Completely overwhelmed with my search. Has anyone else here embarked on their mattress journey and done so much research that it all starts becoming useless information? For every mattress that looks amazing you will find an equal number of people who claim it was sent straight from the depths of hell to torture sleepers. I'm at a point where I've done so much research I might just say screw it and buy an AmazonBasics, Zinus, or cheap Costco one and spend money on a nice topper, sheets, blanket, pillows, and a case of beer.

Just curious how some of you decide which to purchase? Last time I did this there was Casper and a few other brands. I'm guessing there's hundreds now."
"Bed-in-a-box stuck in delivery. How long can it stay in the box?. Hi folks!
How long can a memory foam mattress stay in the box?

I have a friend who is moving in a week’s time and has ordered a mattress from Zinus. Now, due to increased demand in online shopping things are getting delivered late. With this mattress, it was shipped by zinus a week ago. The website mentions that it should stay in the box no longer than a week. Now, it looks like this mattress may be anywhere between a few more days to a week later than anticipated. How worried should he be in this scenario? Please help!

Link to page where they mention the time it can stay in the box:

"Very specific bed/mattress need. Any ideas?. So I need something to act as a base on slats for a cotton down shikibuton. Ideally it will need to be first and foremost breathable, and also rigid/dense/firm enough to make up for the gaps between the slats. At the same time the Max thickness I can use is 1"".

If anyone is curious I am using these in combination with a Ikea hemnes daybed, and jlife twin sized shikibuton with covers. I'll provide links down below.


Anyone interested in shikibuton mattresses I will tell you they are great for storing away/portability and great if your enjoy a firm bed surface.

"First time buyer and feeling overwhelmed with options.. Heya all, college student currently at home with everything that's going on. I've been looking into mattresses recently since the one I own now has been around for nearly a decade. Lately have been sleeping on my back and as a result of that I feel sore waking up. Simply feels a little too firm or doesn't have much cushioning. Currently have a twin now and will either go twin again or move up to twin XL (eventually larger, but not looking this way at the moment due to budget and limited space available).



That all said I'm lost on where to go from here. I'm looking for something that isn't too soft nor too firm, supports both side and back sleeping and at most budget in mind is $500-600. A cooling mattress is also a consideration since summer nights here are pretty uncomfortable. Another thing I've seen is some folks don't have foundations and instead have the mattress and a frame.


I'd love to be able to go out and get a feel of things but unfortunately not quite possible in a time like right now - but regardless I feel like anything I end up buying is going to be a godsend compared to what I'm sleeping on now. Casper was a recommendation from a relative of mine but considering pricing and some of the reviews here I'm still going to be looking around.

Thanks in advance for any advice."
"Beauty Rest Black Fitted sheet question. Is there a specific fitted sheet that we have to buy for our mattress we have the Beautyrest black memory foam mattress and it seems like the standard sheets don’t fit they keep popping off out of the edges so I just don’t know what to search for to have like an extended or longer fitted sheet that wraps around the entire mattress, so it doesn’t pop off?.  It’s Queen size."
"Hybrid Mattresses - Saatva, Helix. In search of some expert advice on a mattress purchase. I wanted to avoid making a purchase this significant without having tested what works for me in terms of feel/comfort in person, but with everything shut down for the time being, ordering online is the only option. My current mattress is quite old and I’m at the point where I’m getting very little sleep - the tossing and turning is endless - so keeping this mattress much longer isn’t ideal. 

I’m a combination sleeper - side and stomach. My shoulders are on the broader side, so I definitely need a little bit of give/support on the upper body for proper alignment when side sleeping. I’m leaning toward a hybrid mattress since I do tend to sleep hot but like the idea of an innerspring core with a more supportive top. 

Budget for this is really anything in the $1600-$1700 range or less - I’m willing to make the investment for a long lasting, quality product but I also know there have to be great mattresses a few hundred dollars cheaper than my upper limit. 

I’m leaning toward the Saatva and am interested in expert/owner thoughts on it. From what I can gather (and from a few buddies who have it), it seems to be a high quality product and has great customer service.

It’s been challenging to sift through all the information out there to find anything accurate, but I have found the admins and experts of this sub to be very knowledgable. Will be very grateful for your feedback."
"Trying to find US-made low profile (7"") king size box spring/foundation encasement/protector.

I tried Luna...but they don't have a King size. There is a network of ""allergy"" affiliated sites selling a US-made low profile encasement....but only as split twins, no king size.

Was looking for a pocket spring mattress instead. We are a couple and we both sleep differently but don't know how to really find something suitable for us..

"Advice: First “Real” Bed. I’ve never had a bed bigger than a twin/twin XL in my life, and I’ve only ever had hand me down mattresses..

I’ve been on the market for a bigger, nicer bed for a while now since getting a decent job that can afford it.  A friend of mine offered me a free Queen bed frame (good quality) , so I jumped on it as a chance to finally pull the trigger and treat myself to a nice setup.

All I’m getting is the frame for free. I need a box spring and more importantly a MATTRESS.  With mattress stores all being closed for covid-19, I am unable to physically go to stores and see what I want.

I currently sleep on a foam mattress from a box (Tuft & Needle).  I must say, I really like this mattress and it made me want to buy another affordable foam mattress.  However, after reading some things I learned that many of these foam mattresses do not stand the test of time.  I want a mattress that will last through this phase of my life (my 20’s).

I am on a tight budget and looking  to not spend over 700 on a mattress.

Does anybody have any suggestions/advice?  Would another mattress in a box be a bad purchase in the long run?"
"Best option for a plush mattress?. I'm pretty small (120lbs) so anything that is 'soft' to someone heavier isn't as soft to me because I can't weight it down a lot. Right now I'm sleeping on a Zinus twin (which to be fair is pretty budget already), but it's giving me back issues as I'm a side sleeper and it doesn't sink at all. I'm looking to upgrade to a queen anyway, but am unsure about price.

So far the most 'plush' I can find based on reviews is the Layla memory foam mattress, it runs about $800-$1000 depending on the sale, $850 right now. I also looked at the nectar (because it's on sale for $800 and includes sheets and pillows and a mattress protector) but it is also rated as medium-firm, so that's a no.

Any suggestions? I've never paid more than like $400 for a mattress before so I'm pretty nervous looking at these mattresses hovering at the $1k mark."
What is the difference?. Since this whole virus thing I cant test any mattresses and I need one in 2 weeks when I move into my place. I was able to test the Serta Stay at Big Lots. I see online there is also a Serta Perfect sleeper at Lowes and a Sleep to Go at Sam's Club. Does anyone know the difference between these? They are all foam mattresses from the same company and I dont see how they can be much different from each other. Also are these any different from the online mattresses like Casper? The Sertas are half the price of the Casper and I dont mind spending the extra on the Casper if it is much better quality. Thanks.
"Seriously... where is my Goldilocks mattress??. Hi there! 

I’m hoping someone can help... I’ve been on the hunt for a mattress for ages. A bit of background - I am small framed (120 lbs) and have hip issues (and low back) that get very aggravated when I’m sleeping. 

I’ve done a ton of research on all the ‘best’ mattresses and toppers based on how you sleep. I typically sleep on my back or side. (I realize sleep position can affect your hips). 

In the last year this is what I’ve tried... 

-mattress + Costco foam pad: I eventually just kept getting stuck in the pad & would wake up any time I had to move positions 

-Layla mattress: not soft enough 
-Layla mattress (both sides) + mattress pad: okay, but we would roll towards the middle of the bed. Not sure if there was just no edge support? 

-tuft & needle original mattress: too firm, added a pillow topper & still too firm 

-tuft & needle + tuft & needle mattress pad: still pretty damn firm... I also have the thin pillow topper on it 

Any recommendations would be highly appreciated!"
"Standard king mattress with split adjustable base?. Hey,

My wife and I have a Beautyrest Black king mattress. My wife is interested in adjustable bases, and in the store each side was adjustable independently. Is this because they actually had a split king setup (mattress + frame) in the store? If I put a split king adjustable frame under a regular king mattress is it just going to be angled and wonky if the frames are at different settings?

Thanks!"
"All Latex vs. Latex Hybrid mattress?. Looking at building a DIY mattress and not sure on which way I should go as far as the base goes. I'm looking at either a soft 3"" talayla top with a medium 3"" dunlop/talayla transition into either an 8"" innerspring or 6"" latex base. Which would be better? I like the feel of memory foam, that type of sink in feeling so I'm trying to get closer to that but with latex. Also if I do go the hybrid route would I need a bottom support layer? Like a 1"" polyfoam or something?"
"Double/Full XL in Canada. Our mattress is a double/full XL, and we modified our bed to fit it. It's now lumpy and slants terribly to one side, and being trapped at home is making me insanely sensitive to how uncomfortable it is. 

We're tall, so we love the extra length, and we don't want to modify our bed again. But I cannot find anyone online that lists this size. Not even Sleep Country, which is where we bought the last mattress. And obviously we can't go into local stores (Toronto) to check what's available in person. 

I checked a Tuck post I found on here, but none of the recommended brands have this size listed. 

Has anyone here found this size mattress for sale online? Is there a possibility that stores with online sales may have mattresses this size and just not have it searchable on their website since it's not a popular enough size?"
"Cheap zinus mattress with a latex topper?. Is this a good idea? I was considering getting a sleep on latex but the price is kind of scaring me off ($850). I'm in my mid 20s and weigh ~190lbs. I fall asleep on my side and wake up on my back. I lift weights frequently and have sore muscles as a result, so I'm looking for nice support. Has anyone had any experience with buying a cheap mattress like zinus and using a nice topper? Like a sleep on latex one? This would run me ~$400."
"Need a short term mattress. I recently joined the army and I’m gonna be at this duty station for 2 years, my mattress here sucks, I’m looking to buy a new one, it’s a twin size, but my only problem is money. I don’t make a whole lot so my budget is relatively low. Can anybody recommend a decent mattress for under 200 or maybe a good mattress top, just something that’ll last me the 2 years."
"Can I put tatami mat and a mattress topper in a traditional bed frame?. I hate our mattress of our king size bed and want something really really really firm, like sleeping on the floor, but we got our bedroom set as a gift from our families and want to keep the bed frame, but the king size mattress is already sinking. 

Has anyone ever put a Japanese tatami mat on box springs and then a thin mattress on top?

Thanks"
Heavy sidesleeper mattress recommendations please. I'm 6 foot 300 lbs and am looking for a new mattress. I'm a side sleeper and I sleep hot. Any recommendations would be amazing since I cant try anything out right now.  With the research I've done I think that I'll need a hybrid mattress but I'm not sure.  I really like the purple hybrid premier 4 but I think that's a ridiculous amount of money to spend.  Are there any other options that would work out for me for less money?

"Helix Dusk opinions?. My fiancé and I are considering the Helix Dusk for our first mattress. He is 6’1” and 150 lbs and I am 5’1” and 110 lbs. He’s a side sleeper (soft mattress) and I’m a back sleeper (medium firm).

"Big Fig owners?. Looking hard at a Big Fig mattress and I would like to get some thoughts from people that actually own one and have been sleeping on it for awhile.  Pros/cons? I've read a lot of ""reviewers "" thoughts,  but I'd like some real world reviews. Thank you."
"Got my Big Fig. Ordered a king size Big Fig mattress with foundation and frame on Easter. The same night, I ordered bedding for it from Amazon. 2 days later, my Big Fig was assembled and I slept on it before my bedding even arrived from Amazon. 

Monday, 1 day after I ordered, I emailed customer support just to ask if they were operating like usual, or if I could expect delays. Within 15 minutes I received a response and a tracking number. Hands down some of the best customer service I've ever experienced, and I woke up this morning from the best sleep I've had in years. It is on the firm side, yet still very soft to the touch. Very highly recommended after 1 night. I'll check back in a month."
"Looking for recommendation concerning the Titan Hybrid?. im 6'2 ~280, and like a little softness, do you think the cooling topper they sell is worth it? or should I be looking at a different mattress, i fell asleep on my back last night and woke up on my side so im not sure lol. i do have a memory foam topper now though, which might contribute to that. any advice would be great. thank you!"
I just bought a king size Tempur pro-adapt hybrid yesterday. It is the most amazing bed I’ve ever slept on! You guys definitely need to get one. 
"Hey where the fuck can i buy a set, i need a goddamn king size bed with bed frame but they only fucking sell one of them like just give me a goddamn set its not hard i dont want to pay twice jesus. "
"Sales after Covid? Specifically Tempurpedic. Hi all,

I am grateful for your collective knowledge across the board, and I am wondering about some speculation re: sales after stores are able to open back up again. I have my eye on a Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt, and know that in a normal year Memorial Day would typically be the next time a mattress store might be able to offer an official discount OR incentives, but do you all foresee big sales (or the opposite?) once stores are able to sell mattresses in person again?

 I am \~30 days into a Winkbeds Plus trial (not for me, too firm, though it is a quality mattress) and would like to hopefully time it so we always have a bed to sleep on, hah, though I am aware that no one knows exactly when stores will be opening up again. Thanks for any insight!"
"30 Day Follow up: After a year or so down the mattress rabbit hole, I bit the bullet on a SleepEZ Hybrid 360 Pillow top.. This is a 30 day update to my original post [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/fjgh9p/after_a_year_or_so_down_the_mattress_rabbit_hole/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) 

It took about three weeks to get through the stiffness and soreness of acclimating to the Sleepez hybrid. Now when I settle in, I feel supported AND comfortable. 

I'm definitely sleeping more soundly (having dreams again) and repositioning maybe 1 or 2 times per night. My previous mattress I was switching positions 5 or 6 times a night and woke up tired. 

Initially I was concerned that the medium-firmness of the talalay topper was too firm, but I'm glad I gave it some time because it's softened up considerably.

The only complaint I have is that there's a slight squeak at the end of the bed where the spring is, but occurs only if you press down in that particular area.

Overall, very pleased with this and 30 days in I'm sleeping better than I have for years. 

If you have questions feel free to ask, otherwise I will give you an update in another month!"
"Looking for a new Queen Side Mattress. Hi guys,

Just purchased a queen sized bed, and I'm looking for a good mattress (and one that can ship to Canada right now). I'm about 5ft 10 inches, 200lbs, and a side sleeper. I actually tend to sleep in the fetal position (legs brought up to my chest) as well, so I often have back pain. The new bed I bought also recommends an 8 inch or thicker mattress, so that is something to keep in mind.

Any suggestions?"
"Base suggestions for the Purple 3?. I have a full size purple 3. Love it, but I have it on the adjustable base Leggett and Platt 50 series I believe it’s called. We got a good deal on it, but there’s a noticeable difference in the firmness of the mattress on the floor compared to how much softer it is on the base. I also noticed that this base seems to fit the bed a little tight. In the corner of the mattress on the left side the top doesn’t seem to go all the way down. I would prefer a more supportive base, one that supports it enough to keep the mattress from going down in the middle and is fitting enough and strong enough for the purple 3.

Does anyone have any suggestions ideally with affordable prices? I would prefer an adjustable, but if that’s just not meant to be that’s okay. I’m pretty sure anything works with purple except box springs and slats have to be no more than 3inches apart"
"Help! Broke College Student Looking For Mattress Options. Hello, I found this sub while researching mattresses and thought I'd pop in to ask for some advice. I'm getting ready to move into my first apartment in June, and since I'll no longer have the dorm bed to rely on, I'm deep in research for my options.

 I'll most likely have to go the bed-in-a-box route. I saw in the FAQs that these are not highly regarded, should I avoid this? I've been leaning towards Tuft and Needle or maybe Purple because I have a chronic spinal condition, but I don't know. It's hard to find honest reviews. Does anyone have experience with T&N?

I also wanted to add that I've never owned or slept in any bed bigger than a twin, even growing up, because I've always been poor. I was hoping to splurge on a full, but I just don't know if I can swing it. Does anyone have any ideas for where it might be possible to buy a full-size at twin price? I'm willing to ditch the bed-in-a-box idea if I could get a full-size for cheap another way. My budget is honestly only about $200-300. I wanted to get a mattress off Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist, but my parents freaked out when I suggested it, so here we are. 

I hope this made sense and complies with the sub's rules. Thanks in advance for your help!"
"I’ve read it all and I need help! ???????. The sub and faq are packed with great info. Thank you for the time you’ve put into it! I’m still confused ?? 

My wife and I are in desperate need of a new king size mattress. I’m 6’3” 450. She’s 5’2” 240. Clearly we need a heavy duty mattress. I honestly don’t know what we would like as we’ve been on an uncomfortable mattress for so long. We are both side and stomach sleepers. Medium firmness I suppose? Titan, Helix, Big Fig, mattresses.com...I’ve looked at them all and I can’t tell what is the best for us. Several seem to have good sales right now - which is important. 

Open to any advice that can help us make a decision! Unfortunately we live in an area where we can’t test any of these mattresses. Just a store on every corner trying to sell a sealy or serta. Latex? Hybrid? Coils? I don’t know! 

Thanks for taking the time to help and here to answer any questions!

"Layla Sleep or ...?. First time mattress shopping here and we have done a lot of research in the past 24 hours. As soon as we find something we like we usually end up finding a bunch of reviews stating do not buy. We have about $1600 for a mattress and a frame. 
We were thinking the Layla memory foam with adjustable frame. Me and my fiance are about 350lbs together (combined body weight)  and are a mix of side and back sleepers.

 Soreness like you worked out too hard?  Or (what happened to me) feeling like your back is going out of joint, things are popping as you walk around all day, and the pain interferes with your mental well-being??  Or whatever else you can tell me.    


Due to environmental sensitivities/budget, I'm EXTREMELY limited as to what I can sleep on.  This has caused me possibly permanent damage to my body, and constant pain.  I can't do foam, latex, polyester, feathers, wool -- you know, all the things beds are made out of.   I'm a side sleeper.  I'm on a firm airbed with layers of cotton batting, and then an inflatable camping pad on top.  I'm in a neverending game of whack-a-mole with rearranging pillows and having pain crop up in a new spot.  The bed is probably both too firm and too soft, but after dealing with this for 3+ years, it actually seems like the best arrangement I've come up with, tho it still hurts.    


I've been to physical therapy for all the pain from the bed, but it's no match for laying in whatever compromised position for all those hours a night.    


I thought I was finally getting a handle on the issue, when I filmed my posture lying in bed.  I could see where my spine was bending this way and that.   I got a couple more pillows of varying sizes, and it seemed like my spine was aligned, but the pain was unmanageable after a few days.    


Basically I just don't know if I was ""adjusting,"" or in a bad way.  I'm guessing the latter, the body doesn't scream like that for fun."
"Anyone tried returning a purple mattress in Canada?. Has anyone here bought a purple mattress in Canada and returned it? How was the experience? Did you have to put it back to its original packaging? 

I have a purple pillow and really liked it, I think I might like the mattress too. But in case it didn't work out, I wonder if the return process is too painful to risk it...

Thanks in advance!!"

I'm searching around for a decently priced mattress, and I've tracked down a few local options. I can go for somewhat pricier if need be, but this one caught my eye.

Best mattress for weight distribution help. I bought a mattress around 6 months ago and shortly after started dating someone that is significantly heavier than me. I can't stand this mattress anymore. I can't sleep at night because all I do is sink into him and it's killing my back. I need advice on a good firm mattress. Was looking into purple but I don't know if it will be firm enough and I heard they break down over time. I can't go to a mattress store because of covid. Someone please help!
"Experience with Sleep Number and why I hope to always have one.. I see so many posts here saying their mattress is no longer comfortable, and often after a short ownership.  I am one of you.

I feel like SN gets some dislike on this sub, but hear me out:

This is a mattress that can be adjusted every day.  What that means is from night one sleep is glorious.  Need it firmer for a day or week?  No problem.  Make it as firm as a brand new mattress.  Need to feel cradled softly?  Lower it down until you are enveloped.

I slept on a hand-me-down SN for years.  Once it got to 30-35 years old the pump started to fail.  After much research, I decided to go with a cheaper mattress, specifically a Simmons BeautyRest in the fall of 2017.  I paid $600 on it.  Fast forward to this year (not even 2 years later) and the mattress is leaving deep dents.  I can see my 20 pound dog's imprint after he's been napping.  Too soft.  I developed terrible sciatica pain that lasted 5 weeks.  That's when I checked out SN site.  I applied for their financing and now for about $45/month I am back in heaven.

For reference, I bought the IQ i8.  I already had the base so I only needed the mattress. The sales guy online gave me a deep discount on top of the sale.

Sure, it's a glorified air mattress.  But it's protected in a shell of foam, etc.

The IQ automatically adjusts for me.  If I'm twisting at night it takes care of me.  It tracks my sleep.  And when I get out of it it fills back up to firmer.  Once I get in it drops back down to my comfy place.

I have fibromyalgia and it's really important for me to get the best sleep possible.  This requires various levels of firmness as days go by.

Am I happy to spend $2,000 for a bed?  No.  Am I worth it?  You bet I am.

And for reference, I filled a warranty claim with Simmons.  Sent them all required pictures.  They have said if I send them $52 they will send me a new mattress.  I may take their offer and use it for spare bedroom.

Tl;dr Adjust on the fly, make firmer or softer as needed for life of the mattress (25 year warranty).  Worth every penny, because you can't put a price on consistent good nights' sleep.

(The delivery drivers said SN had told them they will be laid off/furloughed at the end of the month.  I hope the company as a whole doesn't struggle out of existence.)"
"i like firm beds, but my girlfriend likes soft beds. any compromise besides those expensive remote controlled mattresses?. My girlfriend and I moved in together about a year ago and we sleep on my mattress. I have a firm mattress that I got from Walmart a couple years ago that I really like. I think it's fairly comfortable and I usually get a good night's sleep on it. lately I've been thinking about getting a bigger bed, we currently have a full and I'd like to go up to a queen. and when I mentioned it to her she was all for it because as it turns out, she HATES our current bed! I had no idea because she never mentioned it!

but anyways, we can't really go to a mattress store and lay in a bunch of beds during a pandemic, so any tips on finding a matress online that we could both like? I don't like soft beds because I tend to feel like I'm sinking into them, but she feels like sleeping on a firm bed is like sleeping on the floor. I'm a big guy, about 5'6"" 260 lbs. and she's about 4'11"" 180lbs. 

I have a budget of about $700 for a new bed and frame, but I'm willing to go higher if necessary. any suggestions or tips? where should I look? would getting a box spring help either of us?"

"Review of Brentwood Home Cypress Hybrid After 2 months. I gave up on a close-but-no-cigar Bear Hybrid—it was ultimately too much padding for my 125lb female frame, and I didn't get to interact enough with the support layer. I also overheated. 

So, I decided to start cheap. I bought the 11"" Brentwood Home Cypress Hybrid because it was mislabeled as a zoned mattress. It's not. We're talking a pretty standard pocket coil unit with just a few scant inches of memory foam and regular foam. 

And guys, it's so much closer to what I want than anything else I've tried. It has bounce, like an old-school bed! It's supportive. And there is NO pressure. It's not rated at all for side sleeping, but it feels good to me. 

I had planned to put a topper on it, but no need. I really like the mix of firm support and forgiving memory foam. 

The con is, it's cheap. On sale around $500 for a queen. After 2 months, my side of the bed has broken in enough my hip digs a little. I've scooched to the middle and imagine that will break down soon. So that's a bummer. But it's not hot at all, it doesn't add pressure to my shoulder, and it feels like the beds of old which are so hard to find now. 

And it has a year trial. If it's too broken down within the year, then I'll send it back and DIY with the zoned unit it was supposed to have in it in the first place. 

And yes, before anyone asks, I did call Brentwood out and they updated their site and gave me a half-refund that doesn't void the trial. (I had written in TWICE to confirm the zoned unit, as the pricing seemed too good to be true.) Pretty good customer service."

"Need help narrowing down a wide list of candidates. Any advice or horror stories welcome!. My husband and I are the same height (5""7) and weigh 155 and 135 respectively. We are both mostly side but sometimes back sleepers. Our current mattress is way past its prime and I have been waking up with really bad hip pain and pins and needles feeling in my butt and shoulder. I spend all night tossing and turning and this has not always been the case with this bed. 

With COVID-19 and an inability to go try out actual mattresses, I've been reading through tons of reviews and suggestions and I feel overwhelmed. 

I know that I want a mattress that:

*  will support my hips and lower back- so probably in the soft/medium range.
* preferably on the eco-conscious side with the least amount of off-gassing. 
* preferably on the thicker side... 12-14"" is ideal.
* Preferably under $1500 for a queen size.

Help??. I’ve never bought a mattress in my life and I have no idea what I’m looking for quite frankly. I’m looking for a queen size. I am a side sleeper. Roughly 130 pounds and I sleep alone. I like soft mattresses but I also don’t want to be sinking into my mattress. Has anyone had any real experience with some beds in a box? The reviews all seem a bit sketchy being so high for almost every product.
"Looking for something comparable to Five Star Somerton. Six or so years ago, I got a queen Five Star Somerton mattress from a local furniture store.  Now that my SO and I have bought our own house and moved up from that smaller college apartment, we’re wanting to get a bigger bed.  We both really like our current mattress, so I hoped to just get it in a king, but the store I got it from said that line is no longer available.  

Would anyone know of something similar?  Apparently Five Star is just a division of Serta, but I’m having trouble pinning down exactly what I should be looking for."
"Any experience with Bloom?. Hi all! My husband and I recently purchased a Bloom mattress from sleep country Canada. Unfortunately due to the current circumstances, we were unable to go to the store and try out mattress. We were also limited to buying a mattress in a box due to where it was going in our house (3rd floor up a tight stairway). We settled on a Bloom mattress due to their 100 day guarantee offered through sleep country (although foolishly I did not review their policy on how Covid 19 might impact this..) We opened it up today and tried it out. To my horror, it is wayyyy too soft. My husband and I are both on the heavier side (230 and 190 respectively) He’s a side sleeper and I sleep on my side/back. Please tell me we didn’t make a huge mistake. Could a topper help? Think it might “firm up” in the next couple days? I appreciate all your insight and expertise."
"Online mattress companies (Nest) increased pricing?. I recently purchased a Nest Love & Sleep queen mattress in August 2018. It was $599 and I don't believe it was any kind of sale. I'm looking to replace a king mattress with a Love & Sleep, as well, but looking at the website now it seems prices have shot up considerably. I found an older review (presumably; no date) of Nest that gives its pricing structure with $599/$749 for queen/king, but right now they're $1000/$1215 on Nest. But if, on the website, you go to ""Mattresses"" at the top and then hover over ""Love & Sleep"" in the dropdown, it says ""Starting at $499"" but no mattress is $499. The twin is $714.

So my question is: is this pandemic- (and thus supply-) related? Should the price go back to normal soon? Or is this the new normal? Hoping someone with more experience or someone that purchased recently can shed some light on this."
College student needs a mattress for dorm. Any recommendations?. Hiya everyone so I'll cut to the chase I need a mattress. I'm 6'2 between 215-220 lbs. I usually sleep/wake up on my side.

"Nectar Mattress. Can't get comfortable.. I am a pretty big guy (5'10, 280 lbs), and my wife is 5'6, 170 lbs.  We got a Nectar about 3-4 weeks ago and I just can't seem to get comfortable on it.  It'll be ok when I first lay down, but I'm constantly waking up with soreness.  I'm a side-sleeper, always have been, and when I wake up my lower hips and posterior are very sore.  When I laid on the Nectar straight up for the first week, it felt like I was bottoming it out, I could feel that it was very hard under my hips.  I contacted the support team and they told me that I was not too heavy for the bed and that it would take time to ""adjust.""  They recommended maybe getting a memory foam topper for it.    
I saw on reddit where a larger gentleman had gotten a memory foam topper and it worked well for him, specifically one from Costco.  In the last 2-3 weeks I have now tried both that one and an ""Allswell"" topper from Walmart, both 3 inches, with the Costco one being notably firmer and more dense than the Walmart one.  I think the Walmart one is better, but still not great.

We did not buy the foundation, instead we got a king size build-it-yourself metal frame from Amazon.  It has metal slats, so we put plywood down (about 3/4 inch thick, very sturdy) to make it totally flat.  I have read that Nectar does not require a box spring... but several people I have talked to say that it's better with a box spring.  We still have the sort of dilapidated box springs (2 twin xls) from our old bed... maybe that's next to try?  


I am really at my wits end with this.  And we probably can't get a refund since we bought it from a store, and we used our one free exchange already getting rid of the mattress we initially bought, which was far too soft (I sunk in and it messed up my back).  I feel like the Nectar CAN be a good bed, and due to it's firmness, it fixed my sciatica issues in the first night I laid on it.  But I could only stay on it for 6-7 hours before waking up very sore.  


Any ideas?  Do I need a new topper?  or should I try the old box springs??  I'm at my wits end, i need to get a good night's sleep before I go completely insane."

"Mistakes To Avoid While Buying a New Mattress. Buying a new mattress is a frightening mission that few appreciate. The range of charges, capabilities, and stores can make your head spin. It would not have to be this hard. Bearing a few matters in mind whilst you try to discover that perfect region to sleep can ease that huge buy anxiety.

Quite a few people undervalue the time they spend in bed. A reasonably-priced innerspring mattress will now not relieve pressure points close to in addition to reminiscence foam or latex, which means that more tossing and turning, and less deep restful sleep.

# 9. Think about the durability of the mattress

Bed lifespan is crucial to take into account as it influences the value of the mattress relative to time. An excellent latex mattress will stay a top rate sound asleep surface for two times so long as an innerspring mattress. Make sure to ask about warranties on any bed you're considering.

My partner bought a firm full-size mattress before we moved in together and now that we're living  together (approx. 8 months) I've been having trouble sleeping. I'm a side sleeper and have been having shoulder and hip pain throughout the night. I'm young, healthy, and regularly active so I don't think there is any reason I'd be in pain besides the type of mattress we have. 

I've tried a new, firmer, pillow which helped for a little while with the shoulder pain but that has recently come back. I also placed an old 1-inch foam egg crate mattress topper on my side of the bed and which hasn't worked super great either. 

Do you have any suggestions for a mattress topper that would relieve my pain but wouldn't take up the entire bed since my partner likes the current firmness of the mattress? TIA"
"Looking for something similar to my old seals - includes tag. Hi folks

My bed is done. I’ve had it 9 years. My hips are killing me. It’s listed as a firm bed, which is boggling, because I hate firm beds. Maybe the pillow topper negates that somewhat? In other words, I’m not looking for a traditional firm bed. My wife and I are side sleepers. I’m 6ft 200 plus or minus 10 pounds. My wife is 5’2 and 125. In the past year, I’ve added foam toppers to help. Some help my hip, some don’t. I worry about buying a foam mattress. They seem to degrade quickly or there simply isn’t enough of a history on them. 

I added the tag of my old bed. I’m hoping there are some mattress tag wizzes that find this useful. [bed tag](https://imgur.com/gallery/qVWE2kQ)"

"Costco Novaform , the jury is out..  I am sick and tired of spending  2 grand or more on mattresses that last about less then 5 years. Today I said the heck with it and bought the Novaform Comfort Grande Gel Memory Foam 14"" with Evencor gel plus. It is on sale at Costco for $399.00. (Queen). I figure I have never had a mattress I have loved for long. With Costco's great return policy, what do I have ? If it only last a few years at least I am not out thousands. It is out of the box now and doing its airing out and expanding evenly so far. I am heavy and a side and back sleeper. My hope is to up date this as time goes by. Anyone have experience with this mattress?"
"I have a hand-me-down 15 y/o mattrees, worth it to try a topper first?. Covid has shown me that I really need a new mattress. My back and neck have been hurting and there are distinct ""me"" shaped indentations in it. I know it's probably time for a new one but now is not an idea time to buy, with being unable to actually go to a store and try one out. Also, buying a mattress is going to be a major purchase for me so I don't want to do it lightly. 

&#x200B;

Would it be worth it to get a mattress topper to see if that helps while I wait or will it only help minimally? I don't really want to shell out $100+ to turn around and have to spend $700+ in the following weeks."

"King size mattress upgrade for pregnant wife.. Hello all,

We are looking to upgrade our queen size mattress to a king. We want something that can be comfortable enough as we are both combination sleepers, but also supportive because we are 15 weeks expecting. Our budget is below 1500, preferably closer to 1000. We have a sams club, mattress firm, and then other furniture stores.  We thought about getting a bed in a box, but the only one she would feel comfortable enough purchasing is purple, and I don't know if I can get on board with that. 

What are some mattresses that you would recommend? Where should we look?"

"Experiment Failed ! Back in the market. Hello folks,

  Based on a lot of research , we ordered a couple of hybrid mattresses from Arizona premium mattresses last year. I am sorry to say that our experiment failed. We wake up daily with aches and pains. We even ordered toppers from them with different firmness  to see if anything changes in terms of comfort but nothing seems to work. They have a very limited return policy so I am left with $2000 sunk costs (mattresses, toppers, shipping back and forth) at this point. That gentleman at the factory was great to work with. The mattress just did not work out for us is all I can conclude.

   I am back in the market for a new mattress. I want to go with a company that has a flexible  exchange policy so that I can be assured that I will end up with the right mattress for my needs. I am looking at Nectar, Caspar, Purple at the moment. We are looking for two Twin XLs. Budget of about $1500 each. What do you guys suggest?"
"Avocado vs My Green Mattress. So i'm 5'3"" and around 115-120lbs, and as an artist and long-term computer user, I have a lot of upper back pain and neck pain! Chiropractor was useless, haven't gone back since my 8ish weeks of 3x a week treatment doing nothing. Scoliosis and the like at 23. lots of fun!  


I just bought an ergonomic pillow to help out with my neck, but my mattress is long overdue to be replaced. I think it was like a 200 dollar mattress from goodwill or something over 5 years ago if not longer. It hurts! I can feel every spring in it :)   


I don't want an all foam bed though, and I have allergies/sensitivities to things and primarily don't want a mattress with a fiberglass cover. I should be getting a bit over 2k backpay from unemployment and am blessed to be living at home so I can splurge on something nice for myself. I don't really want to drop over 1k on a mattress but some things are necessary.  


I tend to sleep on my left side as it eases my digestive issues(ulcerative colitis) but I kind of flop all over between left, right, stomach, and back. I tend to prefer more firm mattresses and rather get one that's more medium or firm than soft so I have the option of adding a topper to it.  


I've been kind of wooed by avocado and struggling to see the real difference between them and my green mattress, particularly the Kiwi one which is definitely more appealing to my budget at 850$$(full sized). I'll have to get a new bed frame so I don't want to spend too much on just the mattress.  


Others I've looked at are Costco brand ones, Lucid(I keep going back and forth on those, the hybrid specifically), and I think one or two others but my head is swimming. I've spent hours over the last few days on this sub looking at everyone's opinions. I can't afford a tempurpedic and not real interested in those, definitely dont' want purple and not that interested in nectar either. 

Not sure what my green mattress's return policies are, but the costco ones obviously bring some security as well as the 1 year trial on the avocado.   


So I'm kind of close to sold on the avocado one, without the pillow topper and then I'll see if I want a topper later on or not. I prefer more firm mattresses, I think they feel better, especially when I can make myself stay on my back, which I try to do.

Any input or recs for cheaper similar mattresses without fiberglass covers would be much appreciated! Or reassurance that it's a good enough risk to take. :) With covid I naturally don't have the option for going into stores and testing them, and also don't want the pressure of making a decision there.

"Propping head up, adjustable matress.. Looking for ideas here, me and the Mrs. Just got an adjustable bed, though its comfortable and nice to prop it up when watching tv. We've found it's a little uncomfortable on the neck especially during these long binges during quarantine. So my question is, how do you guys prop your head up when watching tv. We've tried pillows, both regular and tempupedic and we cant find that right comfort. As the pillows end up sliding into the black hole between the headboard and matress.

"How big of an impact does a split foundation make?. Situation: Looking for a queen but both me and my GF are very different sleepers. She is a stomach sleeper that doesn't move much while I'm a side sleeper and tend to toss and turn a lot. We're both on the lighter side - I'm 5'7"" 145 lbs and she 5'1"" 130lbs. For the life of me I've browsed these forums, websites - mostly sleedlikethedead and sleepopolis - and the manufacturer websites but can't find a bed that would suit both our needs. 

I see a lot of King options that offer two levels of firm on each side, but unfortunately there is not enough room in our apartment bedroom for a King.

So it got me wondering if it's not uncommon in this situation to order a bed with lower firmness for a side sleeper and add some kind of split foundation with two different materials so a stomach sleeper's half could feel firmer? If not, are there any other options to consider?"

"Buying a new mattress and frame while already owning a mattress topper.... I already own a relatively newer 3"" foam mattress topper. We have decided to buy a new mattress and platform bed frame. 

My questions are;

Is it worth considering my existing mattress topper while mattress shopping?

If I'm going to continue to use my mattress topper, should I consider the thickness of the topper when choosing a mattress thickness?
The platform bed frame recommends a 12"" mattress thickness, so should I shop for a 10"" thick mattress if I'm going to continue to use the 3"" topper?
Or buy the recommends 12"" mattress AND use the 3"" topper?

If I'm going to continue to use the topper, should my new mattress top be a tight edge, firm top?"

"Need a new mattress quick. So my wife and I have put off buying a new mattress and now it is really effecting our sleep. We are waking up sore, and not getting the rest we need. The problem is right now obviously you can't go test out beds, and even when the stay at home order is lifted I am not sure I want to go lay on beds that other people might have been laying on. I am sure stores will clean between customers, but they aren't expert cleaners, they are sales people.We are both on the heavier side. My wife sleeps on her back and side, I mostly sleep on my side, and my wife has some major low back issues. We both prefer firmer mattresses, I could sleep on a rock and be fine, my wife is probably a medium firm.

In MN we do have the Orginal Mattress Factory. After reading the FAQ I am thinking they might be the best bet, but I don't know what to do about trying out a mattress.

"Any ""rules of thumb"" for mattress firmness?. A couple years back I remember watching a Kelly Starrett clip where he said that immediately crossing your ankles while lying on your back is a dead giveaway that a mattress may be too firm. That even just by a few inches, you're hinging one hip enough to create space in your lower back vertebrae, which makes it more comfortable. 

He added that we have all kinds of ways of doing this, like putting one foot under the opposite knee, and it's all a subconscious response to a surface that is too firm for your particular build. I haven't seen anything like that mentioned elsewhere. Have you seen or experienced any kind of heuristic like that?"

Best gel/foam mattress topper for reasonable price. I recently moved in with my girlfriend and had to get rid of my old mattress topper as it wouldn’t fit in my car for the move (and also had seen some days) so I tossed it instead of worrying about moving it. Her bed is pretty old though and while we know we need to replace it I was thinking we could snag a topper to stave that off till we both start making moolah again. I had the lucid 3inch gel/foam topper. I got it on amazon for like 80 bucks and it was very comfy but a little too soft and tended to make my back hurt if I slept wrong. Trying to decide if I should just get the 2inch of the same one or try something new. Any recommendations for brands to try?
In need for an upgrade.. I’m currently sharing a full size with my GF and she prefers firm while I like plush/soft. I’m in the price range of 800-1000$ so far I’m getting mixed review for a lot of the mattress delivered in a box. As we all know because of COVID 19 I can’t really go and try beds in stores.
"Casper Nova Mattress. I think this may be the mattress of my dreams but I'd like to find a non-Casper dupe that is soft but with excellent support.. I've only slept on it 1 night and this is my 5th time to this rodeo so yeah, but honestly this one seems like the one I have been searching for. Super plush but with excellent support. I have tried two super soft mattresses and both left me with back pain after a month or so. I never have back pain. But all the medium-firm options I have tried have left me with hip pain.  This one is plush on top but you can feel that it has serious support. My spinal alignment on this mattress is unmatched by any other. And it sleeps cool which is huge for me.   


However, the mattress was $2,000 yet it looks cheap and is only 12 inches (prefer 14) and its from a company I'd prefer not to support.  I long ago decided not to buy from any company that had stand-alone stores as they have to add rent and other expenses on top and I don't want to pay for that. If you look at the top 3, Tempurpedic, Purple, Casper, their prices are all at the high end of the scale. And Casper has done some terrible things like suing mattress bloggers and even buying one of the review sites to stop bad reviews. They are clearly paying a fortune to buy ""articles"" on their products. They are everything I hate. Of course they aren't the only ones out there doing it but I would really prefer to not support them in any way.   


So, I am looking for this same mattress made by someone else. The Nova is specifically made for side-sleepers and I have spent months looking at mattresses made specifically for side sleepers and just haven't run across anything that offers excellent support in a soft mattress.  I purchased the Nolah which had no support and the Winkbed which is my favorite bed of those I have tried but it doesn't offer zoned support for the plush mattress and after a month I was waking up with a sore mid back. I seriously cried when I had to send that one back.   


If you read this far thank you. Any suggestions for a plush/soft bed with excellent support less than $2,000?"
"Brand Beware: Saatva's current ""$200"" dollar discount is a lie. Previously that provided a $100 coupon easily found in reviews. Now they increased their prices for all mattresses over $1000, and are giving a ""discount"" of $200 for those same mattresses.. The end result is that the price paid is the exact same, or it's actually higher if you're getting a mattress under $1000 in price, but they're pretending like it's a benefit to consumers."

"Beautyrest Hybrid BRX1000-IP Medium feedback. Has anyone slept on the Plush?. This was a Covid-19 online purchase, so there was only so much research I could do before I just had to buy the thing and see if I liked it. Honestly, this bed is amazing and has completely surpassed my expectations! 

I want to make it clear that this bed is fine before I make my next comment. If you sleep on your back or stomach, it will be heaven. But if you sleep on your side it is really going to give you some shoulder discomfort. The professional reviews said this, but I wanted the back support so I took the risk. I would say this bed is more medium-firm than it is medium. 

I have zero discomfort in my back or hips, but I think I am going to have to replace it with the plush version before my shoulder falls off in 6 months. Has anyone slept on the Plush? Can you tell me what the back support is like, and if you have shoulder issues on that version?

My friend and my brother had a Tempurpedic and sleeping on both of them seemed like sleeping on a cloud and I love that. I did notice on my brothers I did get hot sometimes in the night but my friends Tempurpedic was just as comfy but I never got hot. Either way, I cannot afford a Tempurpedic. I am a female and weigh 150 pounds, I want that soft bed that  I can sink into somewhat but still have support. Also, one that doesn't make me sweat at night. I know that is a tall order because I have heard that the plusher the memory foam is the hotter it makes a person.

My current mattress is on a wooden frame with a headboard.   Usually sleep alone but my girlfriend sleeps over on the weekends.

"Pillow suggestions!?!. We recently purchased a Casper Original Hybrid mattress, and I’ll review that in another week or so since I’ve only slept on it for 5 nights. So far it’s dreamy. 

With that, I’ve come to realize my Tempur Pedic Symphony pillow just isn’t cutting it anymore.  

The last few days I’ve come to realize that this pillow ends up hot and it feels hard on my head if I wake up a few hours later. I do like the shape and also the feel of a foam pillow like this. I’ve slept on the symphony pillow for years. This is my third one and it’s about three years old now. 

I’m a back and side sleeper. 

Tried the Casper foam pillow. It’s great for side sleeping, but a little too tall for back sleeping. Stayed cool too. Luckily my wife is in love with it so it’s not wasted money. 

I need suggestions. Other pillows to look at and research. 

Thanks!"
"Reviews from those who’ve tried the Tempur Adapt line. Due to COVID it’s going to be a while before stores open up again and I’m unable to try these mattresses out. I’m interested in the Tempur Adapt Medium Hybrid and the Tempur Pro Adapt Soft. Currently I use a Tufts and Needle original and while it isn’t extremely painful i’d like a softer more relieving mattress since I’m a side sleeper who is pretty light. I’ve heard the Adapt Hybrid is on the softer side compared to the normal medium and wanted some input, as well as opinions on upgrading to a ProAdapt Soft. Id be able to afford the normal adapt but the pro is really pushing the budget. Thanks!

EDIT: A possible important note, I will be living in a somewhat small apartment and will use the bed for sitting upright while watching TV or doing work on a laptop very often (no couch). Would a soft mattress be “too” soft for tasks like this?"
"Mid thoracic and rib pain on latex mattress. I'm on week 7 with a latex mattress from SleepEZ. It's firm dunlop/med dunlop/soft talalay on my side. 

For the first week, it was fine. Not great, but not awful. An adjustment period is normal, so I wasn't concerned. Then I started to get mid thoracic pain in the mornings that sometimes radiates out to my lower ribs if it's really bad.

Initial comfort in the mattress has been fine and I sleep ok about half the time. The pain starts in the early morning, usually once my partner gets out of bed, and gets worse unless I go back to sleep quickly. I want to reiterate, I don't wake up because of the pain, the pain starts after I have awakened, and gets worse the longer I lay there. I don't want to get up because I'm exhausted, but I have to get up because I'm incredibly uncomfortable. Once I get up and start moving, the pain (mostly) goes away. 

I know you're not supposed to change anything for at least a month, so I toughed it out, and it just got worse.

On week 4, I tried my partner's medium talalay comfort layer for a week, it did not feel much different to me and it did not help the pain.

On week 5 I took the latex slabs out of the cover and put the bedding directly on the latex for a week, it didn't feel any different.

I called SLeepEZ last week and they felt I wasn't getting enough support, so on their advice I moved my firm layer up directly under the soft talalay. It hasn't improved; if anything it's worse.

This morning I got up and laid in our old Casper (now in the guest room) for 15 minutes and the pain didn't go away, but it didn't get any worse. Then I got up and laid back down on the latex mattress and the pain immediately began to escalate. 

Here's another weird part, I have several pillows of different materials and thicknesses, and the longer I use the same pillow, the worse the pain gets, so I have been switching pillows every few days but that has also not been helping lately.

I know there's an ""adjustment period"" that your body goes through, but it seems to me that the pain should decrease over time, not start once you're a week in and just continue to get worse.

Also, another possibly important bit of info, we tried a different latex mattress before this one that was  medium dunlop/soft dunlop/xsoft talalay on my side. I was getting an ache in my lumbar area so this combo probably wasn't supportive enough, but I wasn't getting any of this rib and thoracic spine pain, and I did not have any trouble adjusting to it. It was super cozy and I regret returning it now.

What the hell is going on here?"
"Developing Sciatica from mattress sagging. Hello, I'm looking for some guidance as I'm developing some sciatica pain on my side (right side sleeper). My wife and I bought a Kingsdown mattress a couple of years ago as Sears was closing and after 2 years in, it turned into a huge mistake. It sags on both of our respective sides, we were uncomfortable but fine with it but now after 6 years, it's very uncomfortable and I have developed lower back pain/sciatic pain. I'm now at my breaking point.

I know comfort is very personal but I was wondering for sciatic pain are firmer mattress better or are softer ones preferred? 

Due to Covid (we live in Canada) and everything being shut down there's no opportunities to go in person try a mattress in store, so we looking at the online mattress options like the hybrid silk and snow or Logan and cove. Are those brands too soft/hard for someone with sciatic pain? 

Any help would be much appreciated."

I personally am leaning towards the [Comfort Sleep Emporio Maya](https://www.focusonfurniture.com.au/comfort-sleep-emporio-maya-medium/) (7 Zones ,Boxed edges) as I don't see the benefit in getting those extra coils by moving up to the Emporio Black and can get it for a decent price too. Another option is the [Comfort Sleep Verve](https://www.focusonfurniture.com.au/comfort-sleep-verve-accent-plush/#) (5 Zones, Boxed edges).

1. Are my suggestions of the mix above any good? I read that Comfort Sleep is semi-decent compared to Sealy (which apparently this sub hates)
2. Benefit to moving from 5 zone to 7 zone? Firmness recommendation based on stomach sleeping?
3. The way I look at it above quality wise... Comfort Sleep -> Serta -> Sealy (please correct if I am wrong)
4. Any other comments you want to go out of your way to help with would be awesome and appreciated too!

"Looking for experiences with Tempurpedic for a stomach sleeper. My wife and I are moving soon and will be looking to get a new split king bed with adjustable base.  

Currently, we have a Loom and Leaf mattress that I bought 4 years ago. I don't think its provides the necessary back support for me anymore. It seems that I sink into it a lot more now. 

I'm primarily a stomach/side sleeper ( 220 lbs) so I'm looking for something with good back support. I'm considering a Tempurpedic. I'm just not sure which model.

"Helix sleep substitutes in Canada. Hi all,

Just mattress shopping for the wife and I (she's 145 side/back sleeper) I'm a tall 185 pound side sleeper who loves the edge. Was looking at the Helix sleep luxe line and feeling pretty good about it. But then check the FAQ and they charge $250 shipping to Canada (which you know you aren't getting back if the sleep trial doesn't suit), and gotta pay duties at the border (which on a $2k mattress is going to be a pretty penny too and the worst part is that I have no idea how pretty). 

Anyways, I'm looking for a Cali King hybrid medium firm that's on the higher quality end of the materials spectrum and would love to hear what you guys would recommend. Literally just bought our daughter a Silk & Snow hybrid that would have probably been good, but they only make a king (I'm quite sick of my feet hitting the footrails on our current queen.) I'd be sorely tempted to try the purple mattress 3, but they only sell it white glove so I can't get it in Canada either. 

Not too keen to go to the mattress store with the 'Rona, but unless the warranty claim on the Serta we have now miraculously comes through we're going to be in the market. Might have to bite the bullet and make an appointment at the mattress store.

Thanks"
"Similar firmness to Stearns and Foster Rockwell Ultra Firm tight top. Wife and I have had a Stearns and Foster ultra firm mattress for about 12 years, and it's worn out.  We have tried the Rockwell Ultra Firm Tight Top and love it, but online reviews suggest durability concerns.  I previously posted asking for recomendations and was told that the Therepedic Medicoil HD 1000 might be a good fit (I'm 6'/275#), wife is overweight too.  

Only problem is that I can't find a place in my state where I could test the Medicoil.  Can anyone compare its feel to that of the Rockwell Ultra Firm Tight Top?  I can't find a site where both are rated for firmness.  But it looks like in general both are rated as among the firmest mattresses.  

Appreciate any help."
"New Mattress Needed. So...I've had the same mattress for...drum roll please...18 years!!! Yeah. I'm shocked too. I just turned 20, so I have had this same bed since I was a child. It's gross. It's worn. Even typing this, I am actually embarrassed. My parents just never saw it as a priority to replace it, so I never saw it as a priority to find comfort. But the time has come, and I am looking for a replacement. I have, obviously, never looked for a mattress before, but I am need of something that can really support me. Like, support is number one. I am a side sleeper for the most part, but I need a bed that won't sag in the middle right away. Is it better to have memory foam or a hybrid? Any bed suggestions that are worth the price and will last me for a long time? Price isn't a big factor as I am really looking for something that will benefit me for years to come. Any suggestions are appreciated and thank you in advance."
"best mattress for heavyset person. hello, i'm hoping someone might be able to give me some advice! I am a heavier person and traditional innerspring mattresses have always eventually led to feeling like i was sleeping in lumpy pot holes after a few months, and memory foam mattresses always feel like I'm trying to take a nap in quicksand, and I feel ""attacked"" and suffocated on them, like my bed is a monster trying to eat my fat ass for breakfast. Not fun!

So, in 2011ish I got my first miracle bed, a twin xl sleep number, which was GREAT-- no more potholes!! no being smothered! but... the sleeping surface, already small af, was further shrunk by their ""foam borders"" that killed a good 4 inches of sleeping space in every direction. So I eventually upgraded to the 2013 C3 Queen size which boasted their new ""edge-to-edge"" technology and removed the horrid foam bumpers from use. All was good and right in the world, until I tried moving my bed 2400 miles and broke it.

So... I've gone back on the sleep number website to discover they discontinued the edge-to-edge technology and brought back those godforsaken foam bumpers (you feel like you're about to roll out of bed if you get to close to the edge, it's shite). And now I'm at a loss! I need suggestions! For what it's worth I do generally appreciate the adjustability and feel of air mattresses, if that helps. I'm really looking for a brand that has a good return policy, too, just in case-- I don't want to eat half a grand in return shipping! I'm also on a budget and can really only afford about $1500 max including mattress base."

"Need help finding the softest mattress!. TLDR; whats the softest mattress I can buy?

I have spent many hours researching a new mattress and every time I think I've found the one I find a review/opinion/something wrong with it and go back to the drawing board.

I'm \~130 lbs side sleeper. I currently have a queen Costco Novaform circa 2013 with a 3 inch lucid gel foam topper and upgrading to a king size.  The mattress alone was okay but sometimes woke up with shoulder pain and then I added the topper and that is no longer a problem. But the topper is hot! It also adds 3 inches to a 14 inch mattress so now the bed is higher than my side table and hard to find sheets deep enough/stay on. I was interested in the Casper NovaHybrid and a friend just got it who also prefers a very plush bed and said its still too firm. I tested it out briefly and felt comfy for a few minutes, but I haven't slept on it. 

I could swing \~$2000 for a Casper/Purple/Leesa etc if need be but would really prefer not too. Especially if its not perfect. There are just so many online companies and most of them don't seem to be plush enough for me based on description and reviews. I know many offer free returns but it seems like a big hassle and would rather not test out a whole bunch. 

Basically I'm looking for the most plush mattress possible. 

Does anyone know if the Costco Novaform 14"" Serafina Pearl Cool Comfort Plush Gel Memory Foam is plush enough? Or more plush than the original? 

I found a 12in Linenspa and Sweetnight hybrid on Amazon -- does anyone have experience with those? 

Am I better off just getting a cheap one foam mattress and adding a topper?"

"Purple return on different platform frame. Hey All,

After rave reviews from multiple coworkers and family members my fiancé and I bought the purple 3 and after 45 days have decided it just isn’t for us. The sleep is ok but we’ve learned we like “coziness” more than we thought. 

I currently have it on a platform frame from Amazon that has 4.5 inch slates with 5.5 inches between them, I just want to make sure before I call that it will not void the warranty. Has anyone returned without using the purple foundation? Everyone says returns are easy but I haven’t seen anyone talking about what frame/platform setup they had and if it caused an issue. 

Thank you!"

"Mattress Recommendation for Side Sleeper. I’ve been sleeping on my couch for over a month and finally decided to buy a mattress online rather than waiting for local shops to open. With so many options I could use some advice. I’m 5’5”, 176 lbs., and a side sleeper. I prefer a soft mattress that feels like I’m falling into it, but not so soft that it’s enveloping me. A pillow top is fine. A cooler mattress would be a plus. My budget is around $800-$900 but I would consider spending more for the right mattress. Any recommendations are appreciated."

When I sleep on my stomach, I sometimes wake up with pain in the middle of my back, in between my shoulder blades, and when I sleep on my back, I wake up with pain pretty much about dead center of my back, all the way up to my neck. I would also prefer something that runs a bit cooler too if possible. Any suggestions I could look into next?"

"Ordering today and need your last-minute vote - Nest Natural Latex Hybrid or Nest Alexander Signature Hybrid?. My husband and I are both 5'7, around 145lbs and sleep primarily on our sides. I've been waking up with lots of shoulder pain and hip numbness and cannot stop tossing and turning. I just want to sleep! 

If you have either the Nest Natural Latex or the Alexander Signature Hybrid please weigh in with your pros and cons. 

I'm considering ordering the split topper in soft/firm because I like a softer feel than my husband. Or just getting the medium outright and seeing if that feels okay and adjusting if necessary."
"From Canada, trying to decide on a foam mattress. Got it down to Simba Hybrid, Bloom Air Mattress and Casper Select.. I had looked at Endy and Douglas, but it seems quality is generally the same across the board for the price here and I can get the Simba and Bloom for cheaper via SleepCountry right now. I think the Simba is softer, but I've also never heard of the brand. I think it's popular in Europe.

Anyway I'm a stomach sleeper, but I want to train myself to switch to my back for body health reasons. Also I don't know why I chose foam, but they seem popular these days and don't sag as much long term.

I'm probably overthinking this too much because the quality likely doesn't change that much across these brands as all reviews are near 5 stars, but I thought I would look for some input. Haven't bought a mattress in my life so this is a big purchase for me !

"Looking to Replace my S&F mattress of 10 years with something similar.... Hi! My current mattress turns ten years old this month. It is a Stearns and Foster Blisswood/Newgate Luxury Plush. It has held up pretty well, although I can feel one of the coils creaking underneath me sometimes. I remember trying the Luxury Firm version in the store too, but it didn't feel as comfortable as the plush did. However, I suspect I could do with something a little bit more firm now  as I was 10-15 lbs lighter ten years ago lol.

I am moving apartments at the end of the month and am dealing with a nightmare moth invasion in my current apartment. So I'm throwing a ton of stuff out and starting over since I really don't want to bring the moths with me to the new apartment.

I have really enjoyed this mattress, but it's been discontinued for years, and I know that 2020 S&F is different from 2010 S&F. I bought it before the mattress in a box trend began, so I've been getting up to speed.

I sleep alone, am 5 feet tall, and weigh \~130 lbs. I mostly sleep on my side, but I change sleeping positions often throughout the night and sometimes sleep on my back. I like pocket coils and hybrid mattresses. I have a great deal of neck and shoulder pain, but I've always though I just had the wrong pillows.

Are there any mattresses with similar specs or better quality I should consider? Or anything you'd suggest, ideally under $2k for a Queen (or a Full)?

My current mattress:

* 2.5"" High Density Foam Encasement
* 1"" High Density SuperSoft Foam with Variable Response Technology to give relief to pressure points while you sleep: shoulders, hips and knees
* 1"" HD High Performance Foam
* Mattress Height: 12.5""
* Coil System: Individually Wrapped Coil
* Coil Gauge: 13.75
* Coil Counts:
* King 930
* Queen 713
* Full 580
* Twin 406
* Metal corner guards

"Free king 2008 Sleep Number, should I get or no? (Upgrade foam inside?). I have an opportunity to upgrade an older spring mattress to a sleep number, but want feedback first. I have been mattress shopping for a while now, and was set to build my own. When I was getting close to purchase, a friend offered me their old 2008 king sleep number. Now, from research here and mattress underground, I know the pillow top is shot, and the foam under will likely need replaced. So, my question is, is it worth it to take this mattress and replace the foam layer with latex, or decline the offer and build a 100% latex mattress? I have the budget for a new mattress, but certainly saving 1,000+ for similar comfort (if new latex would provide that) is worth it."

"what was your experience like with purple?. Forgive me, this will probably be the stupidest inspiration for a post on this sub, but I really would like some answers!

I'm about to order a mattress from Purple and just want to hear your stories/experiences with delivery, returns, and the like. I keep trying to search and google but I'm coming up short with answers. 

I'm actually buying the mattress... for my dog. She has a lot of health issues and lately has started to protest her crate (which she loves!). She doesn't like sleeping on my bed, so I want to get her a mattress, but for dogs, but it seems like literally the only company that makes literal mattresses for dogs is Purple (most are just big bags filled with cotton). Her breed is known for bad hips and knees, so we'll spoil her. I'm so stressed at reading bad reviews for other dog ""mattresses"" that I'm calling it quits and ordering, or, well, plan to unless something changes my mind.

I'll end up with a nicer mattress down the line for myself, when I'm not in a crappy basement apartment that can only fit a twin bed, so we're focussing on her for now!

So tell me, what was it like ordering from purple? Has your mattress held up? How was it regarding stains, odours? Anything else I should know? Any tips to make it last? (My understanding is that the pet mattresses are literally just their regular mattresses scaled down, so your experience with their regular beds would be applicable!) I am also worried I may have to return or exchange, so any experience there will be helpful. (I did try a sub search but didn't get very far). 

Thank you  -- [here is my girl](https://imgur.com/a/YjEKQc5) with her one true love, her crappy, cotton-filled bed. (She's since gotten allergy shots and looks a little less patchy!)"
"Could someone explain the appeal to Buckwheat pillows?. So, I can't sleep, and I'm willing to spend a lot of money so I can. I bought one of those buckwheat pillows because I saw a bunch of positive reviews online, perhaps also in part because my judgement has been clouded due to my insomnia. After sleeping on one for about 15 minutes, I realized it was $100 of food byproduct and a cotton sack. I could have upgraded to a beanbag and saved myself $95.

Am I missing something guys? What's the appeal?"
"Looking for Commitment in a Mattress. I’m looking for a mattress that will last me 15 years. My current mattress has survived 15 years and is finally dying. It was the perfect mattress until this year.

We’re both around 190lbs. We’re side sleepers. We’re getting a full bed. Suggestions welcome, especially for bed in a box options.

We bought a house on estate sale and they threw in a brand new queen bed for free. We HATE it. The only room it fits in (our house is a city house from the 20’s) is stifling hot. Plus the mattress was uncomfortable compared to our 15 year old one. It’s nice to have the space of a queen. However, between the terrible room and horribly firm mattress it’s just a no go for us. 

I’ve tried Purple’s 4” Mattress and LOVED it. I’m hesitant to commit without an idea of its longevity. At a minimum I want to be sleeping on this bed for 10 years. Preferably more.

We’re also interested in Ghost Bed. Hesitant to try it out but the price point is appealing.

My husband swears the best sleep he’s ever had was on memory foam. He sleeps hot and I worry a memory foam would be too hot for him. Suggestions welcome."
"Mattress alternative for 6'4"" 300lb college student. I've have good experience sleeping on firm surfaces and on thin mattresses with internal springs that you find in most pre-furnished college housing. 

I imagine that most apartment complexes change the mattresses out every 2 or 3 years, if that is the case I wouldn't mind buying a mattress from their supplier as I just need this to last me 2 semesters. 

Over 1 summer break, I slept on tatami with a mattress topper and I liked that as well however if I did tatami again I would probably want it raised off the ground."

"Mattress topper advice: depth of a mattress topper vs the material type. I'm looking to add some softness to my current mattress.  As much as I love it (firm with cushion top so...\~medium firm), I think it's a bit too firm for me as a side sleeper (160lb and 5'4"") and I've been having significant neck and shoulder pain.  My partner (5'6"" 180lb, also a side sleeper) loves the memory foam feel and he has a very old beat up 3 inch topper that we've tried to use, but it's just so old that it does more harm to my spine than good.  We were sitting in bed last night watching tv and my lower back was killing me, just from sitting in the bed!   My mid section also dips, leaving my head and shoulders much higher in the bed when laying down.  

There are so many products out there now it's a bit overwhelming.  I'm not so keen on the memory foam feel, but I'm willing to try it, especially since it seems the technology has improved on the materials.  So many toppers seem to be \~3 inches (my partner has been eyeing up the viscosoft) and I'm wondering if that's going to be too much softness and if I should go for a thinner version (something like the layla at 2 inches), or if we'd just be better off trying something a bit more firm, say the Casper, but still have it be a more substantial addition to the bed.

I'm wondering if people who like the memory foam feel, but have gone with something thinner than 3 inches have still found it to give them the comfort they are looking for?

Thanks for the help!"
"New mattress back adjusting to it?. Hi. I'm 130 lbs 5'8 side/back sleeper and bought a plush tight top mattress and it was about 1300$. It was a serta iseries. My whole life I pretty much slept on cheap latex/spring mattresses. I do not wake up in the middle of the night. I sleep really good but when I wake up my back is kind of stiff, when I stretch there's little pain/uncomfort but not sharp pain. Very mild. I slept on a really soft mattress before where I sink in and the pain is different. It has been 1 and a half week.

Do you think mattress is too soft or my back is adjusting to the new mattress and the pain will go away in a few weeks?"
"Nest Alexander Signature Series (medium side) is too firm for us. What memory foam should we look at?. We used to have an iComfort from about a decade ago that we loved until it started sagging. I'm not sure if that's still a respectable option anymore.

We tried Nest in store before buying and, while we generally liked it there, at home we've woken up stiff and with some shoulder pain and other soreness. She's a stomach/side and I'm a back/side sleeper.

Any thoughts? We looked at the Casper Wave in store and generally liked it, but they've replaced it with a hybrid model as of the last month or two, so we're not sure if that remains an option. We didn't like the Avocado or Leesa mattresses when we tried them.

We are looking for back support (both have some back issues) as well.

Does anyone have any experience with the Serta Iseries Hybrid 13.5 Plush?. I’ve been looking at it and I keep getting ready to pull the trigger but I’m not so sure after everyone speak so fondly of purple? I keep hearing about purple sagging over a few years though. Let me know!
"Why does my latex hybrid with 2.5"" of 19 ILD Talalay latex on top feel too firm? Which toppers should I consider?. I bought a luxury firm latex hybrid mattress roughly 2 months ago that feels great in every way except my shoulders ache every morning and my arms go numb. I'm a 27 year old 180 pound side sleeper for reference. I got in touch with the mattress company and they confirmed that the comfort layer on the bed is 2.5"" of 19 ILD Talalay latex. This surprised me as the bed feels firm and I was expecting something more like 24 ILD to be the top layer. Everything I have read online made me think that 19 ILD was as low as I should consider for my weight, but it almost seems like I'd need 14 ILD latex to provide the pressure relief I need on my shoulders.

I've got roughly 25 days left before the comfort exchange period ends on this mattress. I'm trying some different toppers to see if it helps the issue. So far I've picked up a 3"" Serene foam topper from Target and a 2"" 20 ILD Dunlop topper from SleepOnLatex to try. Should I also try to find a 14 ILD Talalay topper to try or go another route? If worst comes to worst I'll exchange the mattress and hope I can find something else at the store that actually works for me."
"Mattress help - DIY vs. update older mattress. Hi! I have two options for upgrading my 10yo cheap mattress, and wanted to hear some opinions- 

I am a 28M, 6’3”, 270lbs, sleep apnea. Losing weight slowly, if that matters!

1. Replace foam layer in a friends sleep number with latex. Any thoughts on this? I can have the bed for free, just will likely need to replace foam. Much cheaper than option 2.

2. Build my own latex mattress. I have a budget to build my own latex mattress, latex or polyfoam base, Dunlop support layer, slightly less dense Talalay top layer. 

My question is, do you think the comfort will be much better in option 2 vs option 1 (assuming replacement latex) to justify the cost difference?"

"Astroturfing on this Subreddit?. Hey all,  

I've had a few folks reach out to me with concerns that some users on this subreddit might not be legitimate users and might be astroturfing for a few major brands.  I have also noticed that there are a few users who pop in to this subreddit with one word answers to short sentences and always plugging a few specific brands.  However, while astroturfing is a major problem on Reddit (and on the internet) I have no proof that this is occurring.

What do you think?  Is there a best way to combat this?"
"Moving soon, need to buy a new mattress online and hoping for advice. Hey all, I'm moving cross country soon and instead of bringing the mattress and box spring I've had for over a decade, I decided to get something new and hopefully better. I have no idea what brand my current bed is or any of the specifications, nor do I have any frame of reference for whether it's actually a good bed. I've always had sleep issues, but I couldn't say for sure whether they're related to the bed. I would say I generally have a somewhat difficult time getting comfortable at night so I do toss and turn a lot.

I did read the FAQ, and honestly it left me feeling informed yet overwhelmed and unsure where to start. It's especially tough since I'm trying to buy the bed online and have it shipped to my new place - I won't have a good way to get around once I'm up there so I'm not currently planning on going and testing beds in person (which I know would be optimal). 

I've found a few local places where I'll be moving. I've been looking through the options available and referencing the FAQ to try and discern what the best options would be. Unfortunately there's only one place that actually provided any detailed info, so I decided to start there. These are a few that I thought looked good:

&#x200B;

I chose these pretty much based on the fact that they're pocketed coil, around 3in of comfort material, and as far as I can tell with the provided information about them, they have at least 800 coils (though im unsure of that second one). I'm a 155lb male, so, based on the FAQ that seemed right. Unfortunately I don't know if I'm on the right track, nor do I know how I would pick between any of these four. I also don't know what 'Cushion firm' is vs just 'firm' or 'medium'. I think in general I'm leaning toward something of medium firmness.

Does anyone have any advice or opinions on the above? And, is there more information I should provide or a better way to format this post? Any help is much appreciated."
"Review of Luma Natural Late Hybrid.  In case this helps anyone:

I did a lot of reading on this forum and some on TMU before finally deciding on the Natural Latex Hybrid by Luma. We also considered Flexus and Arizona Premium, but ultimately went with Luma because of their return policy. I am 5'2, 110 side and back sleeper and my parter is 5'8 160 stomach and side sleeper. We did a dual Plush/Medium King with a plush talalay topper. We've had it for over a month now and I like it. It took some getting used to but I haven't had any back pain with it. It isn't the same level of comfort we felt when we went to MF and tried out a Beautyrest for example, but the materials are definitely better quality and we don't have to worry about it sagging. My partner likes it as well but would have liked his side to be softer (and he likes a firmer mattress)."

"Nectar temporarily box spring?. So I took the plunge recently and finally bought a new bed after 15+ years of owning my old one (about time I know)

After researching various brands I decided on a Nectar

But little did I know how notorious they are about shipping delays.  So I have everything but the foundation I ordered. The foundation should be here Monday, but my plush new matress has just been sitting unused for the last week.

"Recommendations for 10 in spring coil mattress. I'm getting a Murphy bed and I need a new mattress for it. Due to bed type, I have to have mattress no thicker than 10 inches and it needs to be fairly light - instructions explicitly say to not use full foam mattress (so maybe a hybrid with a little bit of foam is fine). It's also going to be stored vertically most of the time - not sure if that matters or not.

This bed will not be used much, but I do sleep in this room when I am on call, one week at a time. Normally I'd go to the local store and try mattresses, but covid bla-bla-bla. The only mattress I bought without trying was something cheap from Amazon and while it was totally fine to sleep for a day or two, by the end of sleeping on it for a week week my back was not entirely happy with me. So I am looking to buy something better than that.

I generally like mattresses to be on the harder side. Hoping to spend about $500 for a full size mattress.

Any recommendations for models to look at? Yes, I understand that there's no real substitution for trying it out, but I am afraid that I want to be done with room renovation much sooner than this will become an option. Thanks!"

"Help! Memory foam way too hot. Bought a memory foam mattress 5 years ago without much research (dummy me, it was my first mattress purchase ever as an adult), and for the past few years I've been sleeping uncomfortably hot!

Over the years, I've made some adjustments that have helped slightly but honestly I still wake up sweaty every day! Basically I dread the summer because my sleep quality goes down the drain during those months.

What has helped a little, but not enough:

1. Adding bamboo mattress topper from Amazon
2. Keeping my room dark to keep it cool
3. Only using the bed for sleep
4. Linen Sheets
5. Turning up the AC

(I know people encourage turning down the temp to like 67 overnight, but for me it's just too expensive to sustain this daily. Also, for some reason the times I've actually tried to sleep overnight at a super cold temp, it doesn't help that much. The main issue is that there is still an overwhelming heat/sticking sensation between my body & the mattress.  I resort to moving back and forth between opposite sides of the bed overnight to constantly find a cool spot on the bed.)

Any other suggestions?? At this point I'm seriously considering getting a new mattress, but would like to try any other possible alternatives before I resort to that because $$$."

Should I just return it for a Tempur and hope it works better? Anyone have a Jennings and have some insight?"
"Recommendation for a petite individual, please. Hi, I've been researching and trying out some online mattresses because my old mattress (about 9-year-old, Twin sized innerspring, Firm, from Simmons) gives me hard back pain, and it's too small since I'm sharing my bed with my dog. Also my dog is old so it seems she has some joint pain when she's on the bed.

FYI,

**I'm a petite individual female - I'm about 5'2 and around 106 lb.** 

**I'm mostly sleeping on my back (back sleeper) but sometimes I switch my position to side sleeper.** 

**Summary of my questions:**

1. **Would you kindly recommend me some good mattresses for small individuals with back pain? (around $1500 for Queen size or if mattress is so good, I can buy Full size around that cost)**
2. **Is Helix Birch too firm for a small individual?**

You can read some my experience on the mattresses I've tried so far below:

When I slept on my old mattress, I felt like someone beat me overnight - my entire back was stiff and I had severe lower back pain and neck pain. 

I decided to change mattress, so I tried a few in-store. Then I ordered Layla, and COVID-19 hit... so I can't really go to the store and try out other mattresses. Also, famous mattress brands seem more expensive than online mattresses.. I don't know about the quality between famous mattress brands vs online mattresses, though. 

So far, I have tried ""**Layla Hybrid**,"" both firm side and soft side, and ""**Level Mattress**.""

I tried Level Mattress because I was told they're specifically made for back pain relief. Unfortunately, it gave me more painful back pain, so I'm trying to return it if anyone responses me back...

So I'm currently trying out Layla Hybrid. I liked its soft side for about a month when I had a lot of comforter and topper on it, but when I tried the mattress only with the thin bed cover (I wanted to feel for the summer set-up), my lower back started to hurt - it feels like my discs escaped from where they belong to.

Then I'm on firm side. This time my lower back is okay.. (so-so), at least it feels like my discs are in place. However, my upper back becomes very stiff, and after a few days on the firm side, it feels like I'm sleeping on the rock.. 

Through out my research, I read that medium-firm or firm is good for relieving back pain, and soft to medium is good for your shoulder.

But I'm confused what kind of bed I should have since Layla's soft side too soft for me, and its firm side too firm... I was thinking of buying Helix Birch since it's organic and heard a lot of good reviews, but it might be too firm for  small individuals. 

**Would you kindly recommend me / share some opinions or experiences on some good mattresses?**

**I think I like the idea of Hybrid mattress because the coils add more support.** 

Many mattress review sites say all-foam mattress is good enough for small individuals, but it feels less supportive than hybrid ones, I think. (Or maybe Level mattress is not just good for me)

Please bear with me if my post is too confusing because I'm also confused by too many mattresses out there.

Thanks for your kindness and advice."

"My husband says he feels like he's sleeping in a coffin so I decided to get him a new mattress.. For about 10-12 years, we have been sleeping on what once was the mattress of my dreams. We bought a Serta Vera Wang Serene Indulgence (I only know this because for some reason I didn't tear off the mattress tags). We loved it for about the first 6 years. After that, it developed massive troughs in it. I swear that we might as well be sleeping in separate beds. I only realized how truly bad it was when I pulled the thick cover off to toss it in the wash and saw how deep the craters truly were. We are both relatively average sized, him 5'8 about 180lbs, me about 5'6 and 150 just after the holidays or during quarantine. We are both side sleepers and I'm have middle-aged woman syndrome and am always hot.  
The 2 mattresses that I am looking at are the Brooklyn Bloom Hybrid and the Nest Latex Hybrid, both in the soft versions as I get hip and shoulder pain on stiffer mattresses. I like the interchangeability of the Nest but really like that the Bloom has talalay latex.   
I have been lurking on here long enough to know that some brands have better quality layers than others but I'm just not smart enough to be able to tell which of these might be closest to what we have or maybe even better. I would love to stay around $2000 but don't mind spending more if what we are looking at are not even close to being in the comfort ball park.

"After months of deciding, we went with a Sleep EZ Select sleep hybrid 360 and a Leggett & Platt Adjustable. The wife and I had started looking for a bed since January, had tried the typical places, mattress firm, Jordan's, etc...we couldn't decide, it's worse than buying a car! We had our current bed and boxspring for way too long though and just couldn't take it anymore. I kept going back and forth between the Sleep EZ, DIY options, Nest Natural Hybrid, and a Beautyrest option, I finally just caved and went with the Sleep EZ mostly because it seemed to be similar enough in build to what we were looking for and fit our price range better. We both prefer firm, so we went with the 3"" of firm dunlop on top, it was  $1,325.25 for a King, their ""$500 off and 2 free pillow promo"" is just their base price because the ""ends at midnight"", just rolls the date to the next everyday haha, but I needed new pillows anyway, when ordering, unless you want the default standard size, you need to tell them the size you want, so we got the King shredded latex pillows, you can also get the solid ones, so far we like the pillows a lot. Also if you ask, they'll throw in a mattress protector as well.  


For the base, we went with a  Leggett & Platt Prodigy Comfort Elite split king...initially we didn't want to spend that much on the base, $2425 through Richmond Bedding with a 25 year extended warranty, I was quoted $2325 through Restrightmattress, but I liked the idea of the warranty given all the potential electrical issues that could occur with wear and tear for an adjustable base. There were a few features we wanted, the wall-hugging and pillow tilt, which it didn't seem like you'd get unless it were one of the higher tier adjustables, so we just went for it, figure it'll be worth it, hopefully it was the right gamble!

So far it's only been about a week, but we both love it, very comfortable, it's not as firm as I thought it would be, but we're also going from a bed that felt like you were sleeping on the floor, so take that with a grain of salt. It's still plenty firm and supportive with just the right amount of give, so far no back pain, so I can update again if anybody is interested. 

Feel free to ask anything if I can be of help, I know the whole bed shopping thing is a bit tough during a pandemic, initially we were against the idea of a bed in a box, but, so far so good!"
"Having a hard time deciding on what mattress to get. Hello all, I've been searching for something to replace my old cal king that's been giving me morning but pains and insomnia for the last few years. Me and my girlfriend are both on the larger side me being 6'2"" 295lbs and her 5'6"" or thereabouts and 170 or so lbs. we're both combo sleepers and prefer more of a medium firm to firm feel. So far I've been stuck on the purple 3 but her concern is costs so I kept looking and found a few other ideas in the dreamcloud and big fig but I'm still stuck on the purple. Any insights recommendations or advise? Thank you and stay safe"
"New Bed - sleeping less hours. I'm a college student and I spent the last year sleeping in a pre-furnished apartment. The bed I slept on was \~8 inches thick and it was a reversible inner spring mattress. Under the mattress was a horizontal spring plane (made to receive vertical force) and then a few inches under that were 2 curved metal bars just in case you sunk in too much.

I am a heavier guy so my sleeping experience in this bed was sinking in. Before I moved out, I decided to see how much I was sinking in and it was buy what looked like 2 whole inches.

Before sleeping in the refurnished apartment I slept on a tatami mat with a 1 inch memory foam topper between me and the mat and I loved it so this summer I decided to do something similar. Due to COVID it seems like the prices for tatami mats has increased significantly so I decided to get a tarp, put a 2 inch memory foam topper on the tarp and then cover the memory foam with an unzipped sleeping bag.

I like firmer sleep surfaces so sleep has been good, I probably wake up 2 - 3 times a night but from my understanding that is normal. What seems weird to me is how much less sleep my body 'wants'. When I was sleeping on the mattress, there were many days where I would sleep for 8 hours and struggle to wake up; my body always wanted more sleep. On my new sleeping surface, I am finding that after \~6 hours of sleep my body is forcing me to wake up and it feels like I might have more energy after the shorter sleep duration.

Is this a common experience? Sleeping long hours on a bad bed and sleeping less hours on a decent bed?

(Also, on a side note: I noticed that my shoulder tension has significantly decreased in the few days that I have been sleeping on my new bed)"
"Help! Can't find any fitted sheets for 8"" mattress without slack. I recently bought a 8"" memory foam mattress before finding out that an 8 inch fitted sheet is near impossible to find and most sheets I've found is usually at 12 inches or higher.

"Looking for a inexpensive but decent twin sized matress. I've been working from home for the past 2 months and realized how nasty the mattress I've been sleeping in is. I rent a room in a house and I've been sleeping on a old mattress that came furnished with the room. As I been spending more time at home and in my room, I've also been sleeping and laying on my bed much more. I've recently noticed it's become more difficult to make sure my room doesn't start smelling bad as I've been spending more time at home. It's become to difficult to keep my bedsheets clean and I'm sure my dirty mattress isn't helping. I didn't have this problem before quarantine but in the meantime, I want to take this time to redo my room which includes replacing my old dirty mattress. What are some suggestions for a good and inexpensive twin sized mattress? I'm someone who sweats a lot while sleeping so I need one that won't stink up my room as much. Also, along with the mattress what are some things I could buy and put on mattress to help it stay clean longer and prevent odors?"
Mattress.net Kids Mattress. We are shopping for a mattress for our child. Has anyone purchased the kids mattress from mattress.net? I have seen a lot of good reviews on here for their regular mattresses but the kids mattress is different with the laminated latex. Also open to other ideas. One limiting factor is the mattress has to be 8 inches thick or less.
"Avocado vs. Birch, Avocado + Talalay topper?. Hi all, 

Thanks for all your considerate comments on my previous post.

After some research, I'm more into the organic/natural latex mattresses.

I did some research.. and I admit there are so many companies for latex mattresses, and you can even build your own. 

However, I want more reliable return policy and great warranty also I'm looking for a mattress under $1,500. 

I narrowed down my options to 2 organic latex mattresses. 

**Avocado and Birch**

I like their return policy, and the organic materials they use. The only difference in terms of policy is Avocado gives you 365 trial nights but Birch gives you 100 nights.

I want to go for Avocado because there's been many good reviews on this company and its mattresses. Also, it seems they got more organic certificates on most of their materials than Birch. 

But one thing that hinders me to order it is that I heard it is very **firm** mattress while Birch is more **medium-firm** mattress. I think it's because Avocado uses Dunlop and Birch uses Talalay.

&#x200B;

**I'm 5'2"" and 106#, petit individual** so I'm afraid if Avocado is too firm for me. I heard Talalay is more softer than Dunlop.

So here is my idea, but I'm not sure it's a bad idea or a good idea.. Please be kind to me.

My question is **if I buy Avocado and buy a Talalay topper, would it soften the firmness of mattress?**

I don't mind go for Birch, but there're not many reviews on this mattress, and they didn't really give you the details of coils and the thickness of their latex, etc on their website. Whereas, Avocado gives you more detail specifications on their website, so I think I'm more leaning toward Avocado. 

&#x200B;

What do you think? **Is it a bad idea to have a different type of latex for a topper? (Dunlop over Talalay?)**

Would it be better to go for Birch instead of Avocado for sake of firmness? 

**If you have used Avocado or Birch, please share your experience and idea.** 

I appreciate all you opinions in advance. Thank you!"

"Brooklyn Signature Hybrid vs Nest Alexander Hybrid. I'm getting burnt out researching mattresses. This is my first bed in box (actually this is my first mattress purchase, period) Previously, I slept on a S brand then a hand down Tempur pedic from my parents.

"Intellibed indigo. Guys I'm making this post because I have a fucked up back ... Well actually I have sensitive nerves from some activities I did in the past I won't elaborate on .. 

But I went through 5 beds in 3 months .. wasting money returning them and even bought 2 floor models at a deal rate but could not return and had to sell on craigslist FB market ...

I am just informing you that out of all the beds I tried .. intellibed indigo has got my seal of approval .. combined with a steelcase leap chair (BTW I tried a bunch of chairs too) .. my body pain is the lowest it's ever been .. and I do a lot of computer work .. run my own business online 

Guys it's a lot of money but I think it's worth it I even tried the beautyrest Jennings which was $3,000 for mattress firm and it was a piece of s*** memory foam crapper.. 

The second-best bed that I used and I liked before the intellibed indigo is the sleep easy hybrid latex .. I would sleep and I would have minor discomfort and sometimes I would wake up a little earlier than usual but it worked for me

But now I'm on the intellibed indigo and I'm just telling you guys that it's the bed that has my approval"

We're both on the taller side, I weigh around 150 and him 250. Looking for something medium firm with tons of support for side sleeping (stomach and back occasionally). What's most important is something that's going to last a while. Price range is around 1000. We've tried the purple hybrid in store a while ago and we loved it but they're a bit more expensive and we're wary of how long something like that would hold up. Any recommendations or advice would be appreciated!"
"Change in feel when using sheets/protector, Placebo or Reality?. I just received a Tempurpedic Pro Adapt Soft and instantly loved the feel when I first laid down, it sinks in/forms well, the cover is soft, and cool to the touch.

After putting on a protector and sheets it feels like a completely different mattress. It feels as if it doesn't sink in as well/becomes firmer, and the cooling features are inhibited. Is this all in my head just because the original cover feels so nice or can sheets have this much of an effect on memory foam?

"[US] Would prefer a higher quality King-size mattress for side and back sleepers (willing to go up to $1500). Hi everyone!

As the title states, my husband and I are way overdue for upgrading our full-size mattress to a King-sized bed. We are not picky people, we're just looking for something that is good for side and back sleepers. Our cap is $1500 because we will need to buy an entirely new bed frame, not to mention we have a baby on the way (so many expenses!).

I've tried to do extensive research (lots of spreadsheets!) and have narrowed my list of mattresses down to the following:

1. Allswell (Allswell Mattress, Luxe Hybrid, Supreme)
2. Brooklyn Bedding Aurora
3. Layla 
4. Leesa 
5. Nectar
6. Purple 
7. Saatva
8. Tuft & Needle 
9. WinkBed 

These are on the list because I consistently came across these in my search, and they pretty well fit in the price range. But who knows, maybe I'm missing some? Please tell me if so! 

Also, I know these vary drastically in price. Part of me thinks that if the mattress is good overall, I'd be okay with a lower priced mattress because ultimately, whatever we buy will be a huge upgrade from what we currently have (like I said, we have other expenses). My husband made the point that if the mattress is really good quality and is meant to last for years down the road, then he'd be willing to be pay the $1500 price tag, or \*possibly\* go a bit higher. Also, I'm learning that this is a great time to buy a mattress due to the Memorial Day sales! 

One other point: There are only two mattresses that we can physically test and see near us, which are the Tuft & Needle and Purple mattress. So, I'm aware that we're basically going to be going into this purchase blind. 

Thank you all in advance! Please let me know if there's anything I can answer."
"Avocado Mattress Topper Suggestion?. Would love some help with our current mattress conundrum. I know you guys are busy doing your own mattress sleuthing and coupon code hunting so I’ll make this quick. 

Recently bought a King Avocado Green Mattress with the Plush Green Mattress Topper (not attached to mattress). My wife is a 110 side/stomach sleeper and I’m a 145 back/stomach and occasionally /side sleeper. We both feel the Green Mattress with the Plush Topper is too firm for our liking. We tried to add a Parachute Down Mattress Topper to the mix but it was too damn fluffy.  We both don’t like memory foam and the down topper on top of the green didn’t add much softness into the mix. 


I think the solution would be to buy a different latex pillow topper with a softer feel. Any recommendations would be much appreciated!"
"PURPLE vs. WINKBED vs. AVOCADO. Hi! We're in the market for a new mattress.  We've been on the Nectar for about two years, and the bed is so uncomfortable.  The hip pain and neck pain is real.  I hate memory foam/any foam.  It doesn't last - it sleeps hot - it's heavy - it's annoying.  Beds with a coil system will likely help the longevity of our next bed, and I just don't want to have to shop for another one every two years.

So - I have three top contenders, and they're all favorites for different reasons.  

The Purple 3 sounds like a dream as far as alleviating pain and it has the new grid thing which to me, sounds like a foam-less dream.  Foam, to me, just means it's going to degrade, and pits will form, and pain will come. 

The Wink Bed sounds like a really nice, ""hotel"" style, classic bed.  The quilting on the top pillow top layer makes me think that the foam degrading/moving around to form pits will be less likely to happen. 

Lastly, the Avocado sounds like a good option to get out of memory foam (like we have with the Nectar now), and into a traditional style bed.  Coils, etc.  The non-toxic part is good and the vegan option sounds like a good alternative to the original wool-ridden one that people were having allergies to.

"Needing Help, The Sequel. Ok. We are still mattress shopping (from a distance- thanks, COVID) and we both hate our old mattress, a Beautyrest Recharge World Class. It gives almost no support after five years, pressure points are terrible. 

It just makes me sad. 

We had a Tempurpedic and I loved it aside from the sleeping hot part. I’m a stomach sleeper with a neck injury and scoliosis who prefers a more firm mattress; the hubs is a side sleeper with scoliosis and a leg injury (nasty chainsaw accident) who prefers a softer mattress. 

That said, he travels half of the year, so he told me I win.

The mattress is fine however the pillows are garbage, their flat and feel very cheap and look different from the pillows online because my pillows don’t have lines going through them like I see in videos.

"[USA] Buying my first Mattress ever but feeling a little overwhelmed. Budget is around $4000 including a base.. My fiancé and I are currently sleeping in a cheap 20 year old extra firm full mattress with a “box spring”. I am 6’3’’ and 185 lbs (side/stomach sleeper) and she is 5’4’’ and very petite (side sleeper) so unfortunately we are pretty cramped and I am forced to sleep diagonally. I have also had some shoulder and arm pain and even my ribs start to get sore when sleeping in my side. I also sleep very hot (pretty much waking up every night damp from sweat). 

The plan is to upgrade to a King size and find something that works for both of us. Currently looking at:

The Purple 3 or purple 4 mattress

The Tempur adapt medium hybrid

The Nest Alexander signature hybrid

Most likely going for a luxury firm or hybrid firm feel.

Are there any big pros or cons to these mattresses in terms of quality?

Along with the new mattress I will need a new base and am caught between a standard base box spring and adjustable bases. If feel as though we are priced out of buying a split king with two bases and just don’t know the feasibility of using one large base and both of us being comfortable in the same position. Also can all of these mattress be used with adjustable bases even with innerspring layer?

My plan would be to purchase the base separately from amazon and I have my eye on some Leggett and platt frames specifically the Williamsburg plus but am worried about comparability. 

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07P6FGJYC/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=AVVW7LAF5DH6I&psc=1&th=1

This whole thing is just super overwhelming even after reading through this sub everyday for the last two weeks. I guess my question is with a ~4000 budget what is your first choice for mattress and base in terms of quality. I also don’t know if the premium price of getting a king for two people is worth the money over a queen for and being able to afford a much better mattress and base.

Looking forward to your opinions!!"

Does the Nectar ever get softer/more comfortable?. Finally got my Nectar mattress a few days ago and the firmness has been a little much for me. Its been 3 nights now and I don't feel like my body has adjusted. I toss and turn a lot. I heard that it was great for side sleepers (one of the reasons I bought it) but I can't even sleep comfortably on my sides anymore because it's too stiff. I'm 150 lbs so maybe I'm too light for this type of foam? It seems to be a good quality mattress but I'm considering returning it or getting a mattress pad because I'm just not sleeping well. Back pain has improved though. Anyone have any experience with this?
"Everyone always pushes towards firmer mattresses, but for back pain could a softer one help?. I have bad anterior pelvic tilt and I wake up so sore every single day (I sleep on a firm bed, and even try to sleep on the floor sometimes).  Any chance a SOFTER mattress would help low back pain?"
Did we get a bad mattress?(Tempur-Pedic). We recently purchased a Tempur-Pedic proadapt medium and have noticed one half of the bed sleeps noticeably softer than the other half. It is on a Tempur-Pedic base as well. Is this worth exchanging or will there always be a little inconsistency with the king size Tempur-Pedic beds?
"Does anyone know of a memory foam mattress that is only firm on one half?. My wife and I are in a conundrum. I have a bad back and need a firm mattress, but she needs soft one. We used to have a 12 inch Sealy memory foam mattress and she loves it, but over time my back was getting more and more sore, even with rotating the mattress. I picked up a $300 10 inch memory foam mattress from Amazon and I love it and I've been sleeping wonderfully, but now she is waking up with neck and back pain everyday.

Does anyone know of a memory foam mattress that is only firm on one half? Trying to avoid spending thousands of dollars (I know there is the sleep number beds that have adjustable firmness, but trying not to spend that much money)."

"Made a bad purchase.. After spending a couple nights in a hotel I really like this bed. So I ordered it. It is rated as a medium however the immense amount of plushness makes it quite soft and I wake up with a sore lower back every morning. My wife has a stomach sleeper and she cannot sleep on her stomach in this bed has anyone else ordered this bed? It’s about a month old do you think I could sell it and for what percentage of what I paid?

Any other recommendations for a bed that has more firmness for a side sleeper (bad lower back) and a stomach sleeping beauty beside me?

"Equivalent to level 30 on a Sleep Number?. Hey everyone

Before COVID my girlfriend and I went to Sleep Number to try out some beds and really liked the c2. We also learned that we both like the same setting, 30. However, since we’re both the same setting we likely wouldn’t use the other settings that much which makes me think we could save a lot of money by going with a “static” mattress that feels similar. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for mattresses that feel similar to a Sleep Number at the 30 setting? We currently sleep on a really shitty amazon foam mattress and it’s the stiffest most uncomfortable thing."

This year due to covid19 my sleeping cycle is weird, and I sometimes fall asleep in a sleeper couch, the hip pain disappeared and of course back pain due to my old sleepers couch.

I fighured its how the purple works maybe destroyed my hip.

"Firmness question. Hi all, hoping to get some advice. A few years ago I spent about AUD$2000 on a medium-plush pillow topped mattress because I tried it in the shop and it felt comfy. Now, after sleeping on it for about 3 years, the thing gives me awful neck, back and shoulder pain, so I believe I need something firmer. I also need something pretty cheap.

My problem is that I change positions all the time. I would say I'm primarily a side-sleeper, but I also sleep on my stomach or back a lot too. Getting comfortable in bed has always been a problem for me. I'm a pretty big woman, about 5'8 and 100kg so that could be why I have so much difficulty, but the fact remains that I toss and turn all night, always have.

I live in Australia and don't recognise most of the brands or any of the stores in the FAQ, so I'm just looking for general recommendations of what to look for in terms of firmness and mattress type. I guess I'm leaning towards a firm spring mattress. The most comfortable bed I ever slept on was a futon in a Japanese hotel, but I'm not looking to go that route, it's just why I think I need to firm up. My current soft mattress feels like I'm sleeping on a cloud, which sounds great but my skeleton disagrees.

TL;DR advice on mattress shopping for someone who changes sleep positions a lot?

"How bad is sleeping on a very stiff surface?. I am 22 and I have had fairly chronic back pain (bulging disc) from a sports injury. It is usually not noticeable unless I have spent a huge amount of time in one position or I have been doing too much high impact physical activity. The bed I currently have is pretty soft and I am in the market for a new one. I have always found that I really enjoy sleeping on a very hard surface (think camping or just the floor) and I usually wake up feeling great, no pain at all. I sleep on my back and often without a pillow. The question I have is, is sleeping on hard surfaces really bad for your back? I'm seriously considering ditching a mattress all together for some sort of a box spring + sleeping pad setup."
"Purple Bed Frame. Has anyone bought the Purple Metal Bed frame that they still sold around 2018?   


It seems they no longer make that version, but I am wondering if other people had the same problem we had. They advertised that it was easy to take apart after setting it up (for moving purposes) and it seems that was not the case. We have moved 2x since we bought the frame and mattress back in February of 2018. We were extremely careful in taking it apart and also transporting it, however we found that it kept warping more and more. Its even started breaking in the center of the frame now.   


I noticed on their website they no longer sell that model and I wonder if it's because it just wasn't the best quality frame. The new model is now two separate pieces that sit next to each other. If anyone here has the new version could you let me know if it is sturdy? I need to buy a new frame but I really don't want to throw another $300 at Purple for a subpar product."

"Purple 3 HONEST Review. I am beginning to think that all of the outstanding reviews for Purple 3 aren’t real. Either that or the company deletes negative reviews. 

I don’t know if I don’t like this mattress because I weigh 100 lbs and don’t sink into it, but it is one of the most uncomfortable mattresses I have slept on, especially for the price point. 

I live in a colder climate, so the cooling technology isn’t doing any favors. It reminds me of sleeping on an unheated water bed. I am not sure why anyone would ever want to climb into a bed that’s freezing, unless you live in a tropical climate with no air conditioning. However, the worst part about it is this...

It feels like I am sleeping on an awful, bumpy, cheap mattress pad from the dollar store. I have given it a couple months to get used to and I cannot get over the texture through the sheets. Nobody should be expected to allow a mattress to break in for comfort - that should be something you get from a mattress Night 1. I have been sleeping with a throw blanket on top of it to prevent myself from feeling the texture because it bothers me that much. 

If anyone knows ways to make it more comfortable, please let me know. I don’t have anything positive to say about it and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone willing to spend thousands on a mattress."
"Mattress Shopping during COVID-19. Hey everyone!

Because of some unfortunate circumstances, I need to go mattress shopping while every mattress store in my area is closed. I have to leave my dorm and now will be moving into an apt. I will have an air mattress I can borrow but I'll need to find something more permanent. That being said, even though a lot of mattress in a box options look attractive, I honestly don't know what to buy as it all looks very overwhelming. So far, my eyes have been glued to Casper and Tuft & Neeedle's Mint mattress.

As much as memory foam has been great, my biggest concern for me was when I slept on memory foam the last time. Technically, I was with another yuy on a twin sized bed (and we're both around 240 each), so it was definitely not going to be great and it showed, I woke up with shoulder pain. I also had issues regulating my body temperature a lot, so parts of me will feel both hot and cold (mostly hot).

I have a friend of a friend who works at mattress firm, I didn't tell him exactly the situation that warranted the purchase, but told him I have to go hunt for one and asked for some advice. I'm tempted to get the Mint Mattress since it's on sale, but I'm just torn here."

"Firm foam or hybrid ideas?. Ok so I've done a ton of reading here but still struggling and figured I'd solicit some ideas to brainstorm.

I currently sleep alone, about 170#, a little over 6'.  Have a number of back issues, so I generally like firm mattresses, even though I sleep on my side.

I don't care a TON about longevity as I think at this point with my spine, I really should replace my mattress every 5-7 years.  So with that, while I'm ok with spending what is needed, I obviously don't want to spend $2k and then have to replace it quickly when it loses 20% of its support.

I was intrigued about Novosbed, as you can get a firm, and then if needed soften it up with a comfot+ topper.  I also considered the Helix twilight, but saw some comments about their foam being not so great...  Tuft & Needle doesn't seem to have a firm specific option.  Similar Avacado, and others.

I really don't want any latex at this point.  I have a latex mattress and am thinking the memory foam will allow me better contouring support and hopefully will help align my spine better.

 I'd appreciate any insight on the above mattresses or any other recommendations."

I called the company and they inspected it and labeled it as defective and I chose another full size bed and box spring (Beauty Rest). The second mattress lasted about 58 days until I started having the same symptoms (back and neck pain).

"Tell me about your Purple Experience. After trying out nearly every mattress in Mattress Firm I fell in love with the feel of the Purple Hybrid 3.

I don’t buy into hype or advertisement, this was purely how I felt on the mattress. I’d love to hear from anyone who’s had the mattress whether you loved it or hated it. How did it hold up over time?

Browsing this subreddit while I lay awake at night has been my therapy recently, so I realize I made a lot of bone-head mistakes.

"Mattress firm lied to me and wants to scam me....  

Alright, so here is some context.

Like the title says, I was lied to by mattresfirm and now they want to charge me for an issue on their part.

Recently, I was looking for a new mattress and decided to buy a sleep's snug memory foam queen size mattress. I snagged the snug 8"" model for around 390.00 taxes included.

I waited for my purchase to arrive and saw that to my gleeful surprise, that the better more luxurious 10 inch doze model was on sale, and cheaper than the snug model and decided that I was going to cancel my current order to purchase that one so I called my local store and filled for a cancellation request. The associate that answered was very polite and kind , I told her that i'd like to cancel my current order and she said she'd check and to see what she can do.

A few days later I called back to inquire about the cancellation process, she said that she was waiting for IT to open the support ticket or something and told me not to worry and that she was working on it.

A few days later she messaged me on Google Maps saying that she had cancelled the order, and that 5 or so days later my money would be credited into my bank account.

All well and done right? I thought that she had cancelled my order and that my better and less costly mattress was on the way.

Well today, the mattress I thought I ordered had arrived and I was excited to open it and get it set up. Until I realized on the side of the box that it said SNUG Memory Foam Mattress. My first thought was ""Hey, that's a little weird but I'm sure they ran out of packaging or something so they sent me the mattress in this box."" Until I opened it and very clearly saw the SNUG label on the mattress and I had not even removed it out of it's plastic packaging. So I was shocked, I thought that maybe mattressfirm had sent me the wrong mattress. So I called the store and inquired about getting the wrong mattress, however this time the sweet kind woman that had taken my phone calls when I first started calling did not pick up but a rude, disrespectful man who told me that he was not responsible for online orders.

Alright, so mattressfirm is trying to pull a fast one I thought until I checked my bank and found that I did NOT get the money refunded into my account and mattressfirm did not cancel the order but instead sent me the mattress I cancelled. I checked the tracking # on the side of the box and it matched the first orders tracking number. Wow, mattressfirm basically lied to me and sent me the mattress that I cancelled before it was even shipped out as I canceled the mattress and got told that it was cancelled before the shipping date on the mattressfirm delivery tracker.

So I called the store again, told them that I cancelled an order but I still got it, and yet Todd, (that was the rude arrogant male associates name) told me that he was not responsible and basically told me that I would have to pay a return and pick up fee of 99 dollars and a 10 percent restocking fee.

Alright, so in essence I was lied to by mattressfirm when I told them I'd like to cancel an order, telling me that yes they did cancel my order and that I would soon get refunded. Only to still receive the mattress in the mail but that I also had to pay a 10 percent restocking fee and a 99 dollar pick up fee.

I am stuck with a mattress that I cancelled, that the associates lied to me about, that was 75 dollars more expensive than it's better model, and now mattressfirm still wants to charge me a 100 dollar pick up and 10 percent restocking fee.

I need advice on how to handle this matter, what can I do?"

How to calculate density of foam?. A mattress I'm looking at has a 2.5lbs/cft airfoam and then a 1.6lb/cft density gel foam layer. Does that mean the density is 2.5lbs/cft or 4.1lbs/cft ? Do you take the cumulative amount of the layers or just the highest layer ?

First, both of us are fairly heavy (I'm 6""1 and 350) and being the gentleman I am wont post her weight (also I dont want to die) but we are mostly worried about the durability of the Purple 4. It's quite an investment and we'd like it to last

"DIY Latex Mattress Question. Hello! 

So we recently bought three king size 3” toppers from sleeponlatex. The base is firm, one medium firm, and one soft. At first we had the soft on top but it didn’t have enough lumbar support for my partner. We took it off and the medium firm + firm is just too firm. We’re playing around and put the soft in the middle and it’s the most comfortable so far but we’re wondering if this would cause the soft to deteriorate faster or if this is just generally not a recommended placement? 

We initiated a return on the soft topper but figured we’d try some other configurations while we wait for them to ship us the box. We had originally planned to swap it out for another medium firm but maybe not if a different configuration of the three we already have ends up working. 

Any thoughts appreciated! Thanks!"

Will they accept the return with the damage? What should I do?

"Recommendation for mattress: Young couple back & side sleeper. (CANADA). I am looking for a mattress for my boyfriend and I and oh boy am I lost in the woods. I am a 5'9 160 lbs back sleeper and he is 5'11 175 lbs side sleeper. I generally prefer a firmer bed but I am looking for something that would satisfy both sleeping styles and limit motion transfer. Online I have seen rave reviews for the Casper, Puffy, Leesa and Purple brands but I am not sure how trustworthy those reviews are or which models would be best suited for us. Are there other brands that we should be looking at that are better suited/ better priced? We could really use some guidance."
"Queen size bed recommendation?. Okay, so this is for me and my partner, i'm 5'8 and about 245, they are 5'2 and about 175. 

We're both primarily side sleepers, and both have scoliosis. Theirs is worse than mine but they never really have back pain, meanwhile I have been having it a lot more lately and realized our mattress is a large part of the problem. 

Looking for a hybrid because they seem to be better for those that are bigger, and about a medium in terms of firmness. I need it to have cushion for my hips when I sleep on my sides but firm enough to support my back when laying on it. 

I always had a twin bed growing up and we currently have their full size one from their childhood bedroom but it's shitty and kinda gross (house with lots of cat hair and heavy smoking indoors in rooms next door). Was going to buy a new mattress topper but realized we just needed a new mattress and are in a place to buy new for the first time ever for both of us. 

We're looking at the tuft and needle hybrid, after doing a bit of research that's what was looking best to us, does anyone have personal experience with it and think it would be good? Or do you have others that you would recommend instead? 

Looking to buy soon so can't go in person to try out, but neither one of us is honestly super picky. We've always just had new beds come from our parents' friends who didn't need them anymore and have never gotten a new one so wanna do our due diligence before making such a large purchase. 

Budget around $1,200 with little bit of wiggle room."
Looking for mattresses with low/no smell. I've noticed many mattress reviews that comment on mattresses having an odor that doesn't dissipate quickly. Is this more common with BIAB? Any recommendations for mattresses with low/no odor?
"looking for a mattress for a 280 lbs side sleeper.. I'm trying to find a good quality mattress. I did have a beauty rest plush mattress but after 3 years it developed a sag. I have been considering a Purple hybrid mattress and a Bear hybrid mattress.

"Does the Emma Mattress have any problems with static electricity?. Hi there.

I was just wondering if these mattresses have any problems regarding static electricity. I'm particularly sensitive to that sensation, so I want to make sure this mattress is antistatic."
"Tuft and Needle Pillow recommendation. Basically, I'm a side sleeper trying the Tuft and Needle Mint. Rest of body feels phenomenal when waking up. However I got a splitting headache. I usually go with a pretty firm pillow. So I tried getting less firm and the neck would hurt instead. I was wondering, before I go back to the drawing board with mattresses as it is the best mattress in my life for the not-head-and-neck parts of my body, if there were pillow types that worked best. I also tried the Tuft and Needle pillow, but it was in the category of not enough support and would cause neck issues."
"My back hurts and I'm going crazy trying to find a mattress - help?. I haven't had a proper mattress in the last 10 years. I slept for a while on a Japanese futon because the bed I grew up sleeping on was awful. Sleeping on a buckwheat harder futon on the floor wasn't actually too bad (as far as I remember) but I'm unable to use it anymore in my current living space (space issues). Because of that and also because sleeping on the floor in my room is cold I bought a cheap futon bed with frame from Ikea which I've been using for the last couple of years. It currently has a foam top on it which I think only makes my sleep worse. 

I've been looking at mattresses for the last year - trying them out in store - and I absolutely hate everything I've laid on. Everything feels awful from Ikea mattresses to big stores. I'm pretty frustrated. 

I travel a lot for work and often times I've gotten good sleep in hotel rooms but many times those beds feel bad to me too. I've slept on the floor dozens of times and have gotten better sleep under a desk than on a bed. 

I tried to put my Japanese futon on top of my Ikea futon with not so great results so that doesn't work unfortunately. 

I have no idea what kind of bed I like but I'm leaning towards hard - but when I try out harder mattresses in store they don't feel good ? 

I sit at a desk near constantly and I have a lot of trouble sleeping in general (can't fall asleep even when tired, never feel rested, always have back pain, etc) 

I'm at my wits end trying to figure out something and I've considered just ordering those deliver to door mattresses but spending a ton of money on a mattress only to have it carted away in 100 nights to be thrown into a landfill doesn't really spark joy with me. 

Can anyone maybe give me some insights on mattresses / stores to try out that may help me find a better direction?"
"Do you like your split king?. We're in the market for a new king mattress with an adjustable base and could go split king or not. I like the idea of adjusting each side and limiting vibration, but I worry that that split will get in the way of cuddling (maybe use a bed bridge?) and make the beds seem smaller. We'd get the same type of mattress on each side. 

For those of you that have a split king, would you do it again? What do you like/dislike?"

"New bed - tuft and needle, snuggle-pedic, or someone else.

"One year budget Mattress Topper. I need to get one more year out of my mattress. It’s a full size mattress on a platform slat bed. Budget is below $70 simply because fiancée and I will be getting rid of the bed when we move in together and buy a house next year. My biggest issue is there’s a slight gap between the mattress and headboard that pillows fall and get stuck in. 

I’m a side/back sleeper in mid 20s. I don’t need great, just something cheap and good enough that it works and I don’t have to feel bad throwing it away in 11 months. Any suggestions appreciated."
"My fat ass needs a new mattress. As the title reads I'm someone on the much heavier side (260 lbs) and I'm looking for a new mattress made of memory foam with a preferably high density.

I've never bought a mattress or even made a post on reddit so sorry for the ignorance on both ends. ??"
"Athlete’s Choice Silver - lack of reviews is impeding buying. My wife and I have been on the hunt for a Queen size mattress. We went to Denver Mattress and liked the Athlete’s Choice Silver. We went home and tried to get some more info on the model, but really cannot find anything that’s not from the manufacturer itself. We are concerned to make the jump and regret down the line. Does anyone have anything to say about said model?

Suggestions are also appreciated

* We are both side sleepers and cuddlers.
* I usually sleep a little hot.
* Both short and weight around 155lbs.
* We want something medium to medium firm.
* Up to $900

Any input is appreciated, thanks."
"210LB combo sleeper, am I on the ""heavier"" side. So as I do research on mattresses, reviewers might say ""this is great if you're on the heavier side"", with no mention of what is considered heavy. I've narrowed down my options to two hybrid mattresses, one that is around a 6.5 in firmness, and another that is around a 7.7. I am a combo sleeper, but I spend more time on my side. I understand that side sleepers generally prefer softer mattresses, so the 6.5 firmness seemed like a good balance, but then the reviewer mentioned that heavy individuals might need something firmer to compensate, which is why I'm considering the 7.7 firmness. Is 210lb considered ""heavy"" in the world of mattresses? I do plan on gaining more weight over the life span of the mattress, possibly up to the 220-230lb range. Any insight would be appreciated"
"Essentia vs. Tempurpedic. My husband and I have slept on Tempurpedic mattresses for over 15 years.  We currently sleep on a Rhapsody Breeze, which is the best Tempurpedic we've had.  While there are a lot of things we love about Tempurpedic mattresses, they tend to soften/lose support over time and sleep hot, so we have had to go with medium firm Breeze mattresses and sacrifice the contouring somewhat.  We also had a very bad experience with their Cloud line, which after a short period of time was like a hammock and caused back pain and numbness in our arms and legs.  We have tried finding a better mattress company over the years without success. 

Does anyone have one of Essentia's mattresses?  The Stratami has been a Consumer Report top pick for a couple years, however the Dormeuse seems like a nice hybrid between a latex and memory foam and is marketed as soft like memory foam, but providing better support."
"Down to 2 options!!. So I've been doing a lot of research to buy the right mattress and finally found 2 mattresses same brand different prices same firmness BUT prices a totally different which makes me question if the difference in price is actually worth it or not.

"Wellsville 14” memory foam...thoughts? Reviews?. I went into a local mattress store today (masked up, thanks) to test Tempurpedics and was also shown the Wellsville memory foam and latex beds. 

I was really impressed by the Wellsville (Malouf) 14” memory foam, and at $1799 for a king, I was super impressed by the price. 

I searched the forum and didn’t find much (except a post where a dude was really unhappy about his), and there’s not a ton on the web that seems unbiased. 

So, can anyone give me any info?"
"Mattress Suggestion for couple with different needs. I'm sorry if this has been covered somewhere else, I have been looking and I haven't found our situation.  It is getting overwhelming!  Especially with the current world situation and the inability to go feel anything.  We have been on a base-model Queen Tempurpedic cloud for 11 years now, and it has been good up until about 1-2 years ago.  So, it is time to look at replacements.

I am a small person, 5'1"" and 130 lb.  I generally fall asleep on my side, and wake on my back.  Unfortunately, I snore on my back, so my husband pokes me (mutual agreement, I poke him too).  But, I am a light sleeper and struggle to get back to sleep after that.

He is 5'7"", 190 lbs.  He likes to be a stomach sleeper, but he tosses and turns aggressively without knowing that he does it.  I mean, he will pick himself up and throw himself back down in his sleep.  This is why we did the Tempurpedic before, we needed significant motion dampening so he would stop waking me up.  He will snore if he side or back sleeps, but doesn't really wake when I poke him.  In the past year, he has been leaving the bedroom more and more often to sleep on the floor in the living room.  He says he sleeps more soundly and comfortably on the floor at this point, and then my snoring doesn't bother him.  We tried switching sides of the bed for a while, and I couldn't sleep comfortably on his side either, I think it is just broken down too much.

We would like a king size, but are confused on the split vs whole king.

1. Is an adjustable bed really that helpful for snoring?  How many degrees of lift are we talking to reduce snoring? If it is helpful, we are all for it; if not, that seems pointless.
2. Initially we thought about a sleep number, so we could have our different needs met.  After reading all the information we can find, we aren't so sure.  Is there another reputable brand that will give the adjustability we would like?
3. If we go with a split king for different mattresses, does that make it feel like 2 beds?  If our small children jump in bed with us, will they get stuck in the gap?  If we buy a bridge, does that take away the ability to adjust for snoring?
4. Ultimately, cost isn't a huge concern.  I will happily pay $5-7k (for mattress and base) if it gives us what we need, hopefully not more than $9k.  Sleep is so important.  We can also wait until the next major sale, if it means we might be able to talk with somebody.  I just don't want to be upsold for the purpose of commission, and would rather talk with somebody who can give honest information.

Thank you for any help offered."
"Slightly Heavier Individual Here. Hi all, brand new to mattress research here. I'm planning on getting a new mattress very soon and have spent the last couple days doing research. Problem is, I have gained some weight in the last year or so and I'm now 255 lbs. I've been back on a weight loss kick, and I plan to get myself down to 210-215 again.

My question is, if I go with a mattress that has coils (designed for heavier people), and then I lose weight and get down to my goal, will those coils adversely affect me? In other words, coils are recommended for heavier people, but does that mean that coils are NOT recommended for people in a lower weight range? If that's the case, I'll just go with something on the cheaper side without coils since I plan to lose more weight. I don't want to pay a premium if it will not be worthwhile in the long run.

Currently looking at a standard Puffy mattress (not the Lux). From what I've seen, this is not recommended for someone over 230 lbs. I'm also 6'4, if that matters."
"Looking for insight before purchasing our first latex mattress. My partner and I are looking to get a new mattress and have decided for a variety of reasons we are going to get a latex one. Specifically, we want to order from SOL since they have many great reviews and seemingly stellar customer support. We're both primarily side and stomach sleepers who sleep tangled up a bit. It seems like there are so many options with latex mattress' so it's a bit overwhelming, but the options we're considering so far are:

* firm standard mattress with 2 or 3 inch soft topper
* firm low profile mattress with 3 inch soft topper
* building a custom stack either with toppers or a low profile mattress, firm, medium and soft

We are somewhat price sensitive, looking to buy all in for as close to, or below, $1000 as possible. My first direction question is, is there really an advantage to the third option (building a stack) over using a latex mattress with a topper? Secondly, my partner seems fixated on getting a firm base (if we go with a mattress and topper) with a soft topper. Is this going to be too firm even with a topper? I've also heard that a 3"" soft topper can be *too* soft and 2"" is more comfortable- any guidance on this? I know mattress' are very personal but this is a new approach for us so any insight is huge. We reached out to SOL and will hopefully hear back tomorrow or during the week, but opinions from outside the org would be good for context. Thanks in advance for any and all guidance. Please let me know if there's any more helpful info I can share."
"Buying direct from Tempur-Pedic vs Mattress Firm (Warranty & returns question). Hello mattress enthusiasts!

Whats the difference between Tempur-Pedics refund policy & Mattress Firms?

Also is it more likely that your warranty will be honored if the Mattress & Base were purchased directly through Tempur-Pedic? I'd really like to support a local mattress store near me who are authorized sellers but have worries on the warranty.

Best options in the $500-700 range? We’re both hot sleepers and we both sleep on our sides as well as our backs 5’7” 190lbs and 6’1” 250 lbs. Feeling super overwhelmed. I’ve been researching but it’s stressful and confusing. We will be buying online due to the pandemic. I know we should spend more money to get a better quality mattress but this is the budget we have to work with unfortunately. I’d appreciate any suggestions. I just want to sleep through the night and not be in constant pain all day long.
"Nectar is a SCAM - STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!!. Sorry if this is a well known fact, but I feel the need to voice my story.  (Be warned, this was my first time buying a mattress, so I was unaware of how saturated the internet is with paid reviews.) I'll start by saying that they did end up giving me $45 off my purchase after two bad chat experiences.

Also, for anyone who doesn't know...NEVER believe anything you read from a mattress review site.  99% of these reviews are paid and the only sites that I found that help with the experience were the following:

\- [**www.sleeplikethedead.com**](https://www.sleeplikethedead.com)

\- [**www.ReviewMeta.com**](https://www.ReviewMeta.com) 

First, I ordered my mattress from Nectar because they had a message on their website which specifically stated (semi-paraphrasing because it's not there anymore but this expresses the content well), ""We are unaffected by COVID!  2-3 day shipping!""  Sadly, this proved to be completely untrue.    


Skip ahead over a week, still no mattress or tracking updates aside from the number that was generated upon purchase.  So, I decided to give them a call only to find that their phone lines were disabled because of COVID...no big deal.  Upon talking to a chat representative, I was told that my mattress would be shipped in 2 days.  However, he expressed no concern and would not admit that the message regarding typical operations under COVID conditions.  Thus, I began to complain that I had relied upon that message when deciding to purchase my mattress through Nectar.  Upon stating my grievances, the representative disconnected!  I had waited in a line of over 70 customers for quite some time only to receive next to no service.

Thus, I started my wait again to talk to someone else because I needed answers.  Upon explaining what had happened, the second representative offered an ""honest"" answer regarding when my mattress would be shipped which was much longer than the 2 days that had been stated by the other rep.  This, among other things, indicated red flags so I requested to cancel my purchase and was told that I could not.  So I requested to be followed up by an escalation team member.  (Later this would happen, but they did not greet me with anything regarding cancelling my order unfortunately.)

So, I decided to call Discover who completely agreed that it was suspicious that they wouldn't cancel my order or offer a firm answer regarding shipping. They immediately refunded my order in full.

\~15+ days (can't remember exactly, but I don't want to over or understate) after my order, my mattress arrived unexpectedly, so now I'm trying to figure out the return and they've been reasonable-ish with response but I had to wait through another queue of about 50 people only to have the first rep disconnect once I stated I had cancelled my order via CC issuer.  The second rep heard out my complaints and has been following up via email (albeit, slowly and I still haven't heard back since yesterday.)  \[To make matters worse, the CEO issued a letter over email which said something about phone lines being super busy...yeah right...the ones that say the call centers are closed???\]

The bottom line here is that Nectar is not a company that anyone should do business with.  I have no opinion on the quality of their mattresses but they misled me on multiple occasions and I cannot do business with a company that is willing to mislead paying customers.

If anyone makes it this far, I ended up buying a mattress from Amazon for about half the price that held up in my review analysis and I expect to have a much better experience with respect to receiving my order.  I cannot overstate how poor of an experience I had with Nectar support.  I truly felt disrespected.

Nectar, if you see this, please reach out to me to make this right.  I can't just ignore being disconnected from 2 reps, being given multiple shipping times, and having my requests for a cancellation being ignored...it's unacceptable, and frankly, the worst transaction that I have ever endured."
Hate my new purple. He my first sleep on original purple. My shoulder and back hurt. It’s like sleeping on a rock. My wife already wants to return it. They say to give it a week or two. Any thoughts?
"Sleep Number Experience. Just wanted to share my sleep number experience in hopes of helping others make informed future decisions if they came across this post.

My full size dual-chambered sleep number mattress is a few years old and has nearly always sagged severely in the middle (despite both sides being at the same firmness setting). I routinely wake up with back pain from rolling into the trench. After spending an hour on the phone with their support, they ended up saying that for nearly $300, they could send me out a mattress cover that may or may not fix the problem. I laughed at them. That is nearly a third of the price of a decent quality mattress elsewhere.

Side story: my parents had one too and within 3 years, the motor gave out.  Sleep Number again wanted $300 to send out a replacement.

For how expensive Sleep Number products are, you'd think they would have better quality and better warranties.

I will be buying a new mattress in a few months when I get married, and you can bet it will not be from Sleep Number."
"Looking to purchase a new mattress for under $1000 to help with back pain.. Hey there folks,

As the title says. Unfortunately it looks like I won’t be able to walk into a mattress firm and try out mattresses for a bit, so any suggestions on a reliable new mattress to help with back pain?

"Firm, Inexpensive Piece of Foam/Egg-crate for Futon Couch/Bed?. I sleep on this VERY heavy, solid, what I’m guessing is a futon couch that opens into a bed (I bought it slightly used, and the person didn’t know if it was a futon or not). It’s pretty low to the ground, with short, metal legs. I’m primarily a side sleeper. The problem is, it causes me back pain - especially low back pain. I think it’s because there’s a sort of gap/indentation/trench (not sure what to call it) that runs lengthwise down the middle where the bed folds up when it’s moved back into a couch position. Of course, this is how it’s supposed to be. Does anyone know where I can buy a really inexpensive - but VERY firm - piece of foam/egg-crate, or whatever? A place that will cut me a piece from a big roll because I’m guessing this would be cheaper than buying an already packaged one? I don’t want to buy a packaged topper - they’re too expensive and it’s not worth spending that kind of money on this old contraption of a bed. By the way, this isn’t a regular bed, so I can’t just put a piece of plywood on it to make it more firm. In other words, it doesn’t sit on a boxspring or frame. Thank you!"
What’s the consensus on “Purple beds”. Might be buying one today but figured I’d ask the mattress enthusiasts what they think of them. Thanks in advance!
"New avocado mattress uncomfortable.. I got received my mattress last week and set it atop a metal base from Amazon.  I dont find the mattress comfortable and am planning on changing bases but last night I put it on the floor to see if it was the base or the bed that was the issue. It feels the same. 

It feels uneven in the center both on the base and on the floor. Like it's slightly raised or something. I feel like I can roll from the center to either side because it's uneven. 

I tried sleeping on just the center but didn't work well because I go to sleep first on my side and then roll to my stomach. When I was on my side, I was off center (so either on the left or right side of the bed) and could feel the difference of whatever is happening in the center. When I laid on my stomach, on the center, it was too firm but also slightly raised(?)  It felt like a noticeable difference. The right or left side both feeling equally less firm. 

 I ordered a SOL mattress topper that arrived the yesterday and that I unrolled today. The mattress is currently on my floor with the topper. Hoping it feels better. 

I noticed on the avocado website that there is different coil firmness is zone 1 and 2 and maybe that's my issue? Curious what anyone elses experience has been. I want to try it for a full 30 days but if I can't adjust or need to keep the topper then I feel I'm better off just buying a full latex mattress from SOL or trying another latex hybrid. 


I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed a different firmness in the center of their bed?"
"Mattress firmness and a mattress topper question.. Hello everyone. We currently have a mattress that is about 4 yrs old. It is medium firm I believe. It is beginning to sag a little.

"Alternative Honeycomb TPE Topper. Has anyone used a honeycomb or grid style TPE topper on their mattresses?  There are slight differences in the formulas that make up elastomers for different stretch, rigidity, bounce, etc... so I'm not sure if any company in particular can patent every formula and type (Purple for example).

I started thinking about this because I had bought a honeycomb gel TPE seat pad from Costco a few years ago and realized this isn't unique to the Purple mattress brand.

It is fairly simple to make these bouncy gel like TPE materials in factories using molds and the right formula clearly.

For example on Alibaba there are several factories making them in any custom size (full, queen, King, etc). I messaged the sellers and they confirmed that they can make various sizes.

*That  still doesn’t say much about what the material of construction is. I  can only guess, but I believe it is a soft, solid version of the  viscoelastic polyurethane used to make the mattress itself. That would  explain how it is both soft and resilient enough to behave as it does.*""

"Kirkland Signature by Stearns & Foster Lakeridge - Foundation & Frame?. I am planning on buying a California king size (I'm tall) of this mattress from Costco within the next week or two. Costco sells the mattress with (https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-by-stearns-%2526-foster-lakeridge-cal-king-with-foundation.product.100469620.html) and without (https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-by-stearns-%2526-foster-lakeridge-cal-king-mattress-only.product.100541477.html) a foundation. 

However, the site gives no information about the foundation, except that it is 9 inches tall. I have a few questions about this. 

1. Is 9 inches perhaps an abnormally tall foundation? Some Costco comments said it was too tall. If so, where should I look for a foundation instead?

2. As far as I understand, I will need to place the foundation and mattress on top of a frame. However, I've also seen some beds that just seem to have the foundation raised up with some legs. Assuming the foundation has no such legs, where can I buy a good frame? I have had a hard time finding any online for a California king.

Thanks for any advice you all can give."
"Confused between Classic Brands Cool Gel 14.0 and Beautyrest Silver BRS900. Hello,

I've been lurking on the forums for quite some time trying to get some knowledge about what to look for before purchasing a mattress.

My budget is around the 500-700 range. While I am aware that this is not the price range to get that ""Amazing"" mattress, I'm looking for something that will be comfortable and lasts for 3-4 years. 

I've zeroed in on these 2 brands. I'm around 6 ft, 190 lbs while my partner is petite around 130lbs.

Both of us prefer a cooling mattress. I'm more of a mixed side + back sleeper while my partner is mostly a side sleeper.

This led me to believe that I should go for a plush feeling mattress but not something that's too soft since it might not provide enough support for the back. (around 7/10 on the comfort scale).

Would my assessment be correct?

Questions:
1. Classic Brands is memory foam while Beautyrest Silver is a hybrid ( Pocket Coils + Foam ). Which would better suit our needs?

2. Does the Beautyrest Silver series need boxsprings since it is a innerspring mattress? Is this a decent brand i.e. a step up from Classic Brands / Zinus etc?

3. Do you folks have any other suggestions in this price range?"
"Best mattress protector for Tempur Luxe Breeze. As the title says I am looking for the best mattress protector for my new king tempur lux breeze. I want something high quality that won’t shift and won’t negate the cooling effect from this expensive mattress. The tempur representative recommended their own brand but I was unsure which one they are talking about. The zip cover or full cover. My salesperson told me to order the Pure cafe snow protector but I can find a lot of info

TL;DR : anyone with a tempur luxe breeze have mattress protector suggestions?"
"Broke my Skorva/ seeking pillow. Can someone suggest a budget friendly, heavy duty, silent queen size bed frame that my mattress won't slide around on? Tia

Also, needing suggestions for a pillow that is firm but not too thick, and a memory foam contour pillow that isn't too soft. Again budget friendly. Thanks"
"Looking for good quality, queen traditional innerspring, cool mattress, for side sleeper.. I live in Phoenix, obviously very hot here.  Want to get rid of my memory foam mattress that I got from a friend and is too warm, maybe too firm.  I had no problems with my previous spring mattresses.  I can practically sleep standing up, but don't want anything very firm.  If it helps I'm 6'0 165 lbs.  No current partner so not a factor.  If I remember right last time I went to a mattress store I did prefer the standard spring mattress over even a Hybrid mattress.  Would prefer to spend less than $2k with a new box spring if necessary, already have one though not sure it's any good. 

I know there's a million mattresses and variations of the same mattresses, but if anyone bought spring mattress without memory foam, what did you get and how did you like it?  Thanks!"
"Avocado, Luma or Nest Hybrid. We are thinking of getting Avocado, Luma Latex Hybrid or Nest Hybrid.

We are side/stomach sleepers and both under 165 pounds. We have generally liked a firm innerspring mattress with a polyfoam topper.

We would like a mattress that enables us to change the comfort layer if necessary (and to give some ability to try different things), and also some years down the road.

All the prices are about the same at the moment.

Would love any experiences/opinions about these mattresses!

Avocado Green:

- Quantum Edge Elite Combi-Zone (1414 in a king)
- 3 wire gauges (16, 17, 14)
- 1 year return policy

We would most likely get the one without the pillow top and get a different mattress topper (possibly cotton or down).

Luma Natural Latex Hybrid:

- 2” or 3” natural or Talalay latex comfort layer
- 2"" Natural Latex
- 8"" Pocketed Coil Array (Bolsa Coil) Z(15 gauge interior, 16 gauge perimeter)
- 1"" 1.8 32 Base Foam
- 31-34 ILD (medium firm), 4.5 density
- 120 return policy

Also considering just getting the Luma mattress (it seems to be identical but just doesn’t come with the latex comfort layer) and then get a different mattress topper for it.

Nest Natural Hybrid Latex:

- 1” cotton and wool
- 1.5” 1.5 lb Eco Flex Quilting Foam
- 3” Dunlop latex
- 1” 1.5lb comfort foam
- 6” Caliber Edge Coil Support, 16 gauge
- 1” 1.5lb base foam
- 120 return policy
- (have heard that Nest has had some quality control issues though)"
"Non waterproof zippered encasement or cover?. I’m adding a 2” latex topper to my memory foam and would love to zip a cover over the entire thing. 

But, I cannot find a non-waterproof case/encasement/zippered cover. 

I don’t care about it being waterproof and I am avoiding the waterproof ones because I don’t want to be hot. 

The current zippered “cover” on my memory foam is a like a 2 milliliter thick sock, it’s so thin it’s transparent! Does anyone sell those?

Basically I just want the new topper all zipped together without adding any heat retention. 

Why are these so hard to find?"
"Overweight Side Sleeper. Looking for recommendations and reviews for an online mattress. I am a 5'4 female, 260 pounds. I sleep on my side 80-90% of the time and occasionally on my back. I have pretty broad shoulders so need decent pressure relief. I like the feel of a soft pillow top but still need solid support for my weight. 

Most online reviews recommend a 'plus' mattress for my weight, such as the Helix Plus, Wink Bed Plus, Big Fig, etc but all of those sound too firm for a side sleeper. 

I've looked into the Avocado Green with pillow top, Wink Bed Luxury Firm, Saatva Luxury Firm, and Helix Midnight. They all seem pretty comparable. I've looked into the Purple and it seems most heavy people either love it or hate it."
"Can anyone knock a brand or two off my list?. I'm planning on getting whichever mattress has the best memorial day weekend deal.

I am currently sleeping on a Beautyrest Recharge Shakespear Line mattress which I'd say is pretty bad. I got it a while ago and didn't do any research at all. It is a firm(which I do not enjoy) and has multiple spots of sinkage. I believe almost any half decent mattress would be better but am hoping to get one with good longevity. 

I am getting a queen. I have the same amount of experience with a latex mattress as I do memory foam, which is none, so I am taking a risk with the assumption that the free trials and return are as easy as they seem. I am leaning into latex due to people saying they last longer and many allow you to replace layers.

Any other recommendations are appreciated. Thanks!"
"has anyone here tried the layla hybrid?. Hi there, 

My girlfriend and I recently got the layla hybrid and I just found this sub after we received it. I wanted to make sure we picked something good for us that will last us atleast 5 or 6 years. She's 5'8 at 180 pounds and I'm 6'1 at 270 pounds. So far we like it, but the edges seem to be weak for supporting me. I'd like to see what other people here seem to think about it since they bought it. I've never had a hybrid or memory foam mattress before so I'm not sure how to compare it."
"Having trouble eliminating a split king gap. I've been renting a room for a year now and the bed is really killing me. It's two smaller mattresses in a split king frame. Unfortunately I could only sleep on one side of the bed otherwise I start going into the gap and it's really uncomfortable.

I bought this [gap filler thing](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B017BJSCOS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that helps slightly, but every once in a while I have to move it around because it goes out of place.

On top of that I also built a [quilted mattress topper](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07S18D6Z5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) which helps much more, but I can still really only sleep on one side comfortably because I can still feel a gap or a bump in the middle of the bed.

So I was thinking maybe I should also get a 2inch memory foam topper to put underneath the quilted one? Does anyone think that'll help or have any other suggestions? I can't buy a new bed or frame sadly"
"Anyone know what company made this mattress?. I have had this [mattress](https://imgur.com/gallery/JoBHJ5p) since 2016. It’s one of those foam ones that came in a giant box all vacuumed sealed. The main reason I bought it was because, at the time, they offered a free option: a topper that would integrate into the mattress via a zippered extension for the cover that would either make the mattress softer or firmer. I remember it came in three choices, soft, medium, and firm. You could then get a topper for free making it soft-soft, soft-firm, medium-soft, medium-firm, and so on. I just cannot for the life of me remember what company made it and I no longer have the email confirming my purchase. I’m happy with it so I want another one but I’m stuck. Does anyone have any ideas?"
"Purple vs MyPillow. Hello!

&#x200B;

I'm hoping someone can give me some advice. We (couple, medium size) currently have a Purple mattress, full size, and it's an ok size but we really want the space a king size has to offer. We really like the Purple mattress, and wouldn't be opposed to another. SO is a back/side sleeper and I am a stomach/side sleeper, so we definitely need something a little versatile. I also have the MyPillow pillows, and I absolutely love them, so I've been curious about the mattress. Doing some research, despite the different materials, they seem to have some similar characteristics, but the not-huge-but-still-significant price difference attracts me to the MyPillow mattress. Does anyone have any experience with these two products?"

"Found This Subreddit Too Late!. So I've been shopping for a new mattress and I finally pulled the trigger on a BB Aurora Hybrid on Memorial Day (30% off). This is my first time buying a mattress. Now I know I can return the mattress, but I would have liked to make the right decision the first time.

I did what I thought was a lot of research - online articles/reviews and YouTube videos (rizknows, sleepopolis). I found this subreddit a day later and realized there's a lot of information I don't know. Apparently the mattress industry is a lot more convoluted than I thought. And it seems like barely anyone on this subreddit has an Aurora hybrid to get feedback from which sucks. Unfortunately I don't have enough time to go in store and try different mattresses and I'm not sure if it's even possible because of covid. 

The bed I ordered may be great for me, but only time will tell. I will be doing additional research and following this subreddit to learn more. Maybe I'll be able to snag a deal on the Fourth of July!

I am a side sleeper and sometimes go on my back. I was interested in hybrid mattresses because of the extra bounce.  I sleep hot, which is why I thought the Aurora would be nice. If you have any mattress suggestions, please let me know. Thank you guys for all the info and help!

Edit: sleep preferences"
"Nest Bedding Love and Sleep Warranty Denied. Today Nest Bedding denied my warranty claim on my Love and Sleep mattress. I have had the mattress for about 3 years. About a month ago now, I started waking up with low back pain. Initially I did not attribute it to my mattress. However, no matter how many stretches or exercises I did, the pain would no go away. 

I decided to try and sleep on the mattress in my guest room which is a Novaform. After one night on that mattress, I was no longer waking up with back pain. This is what led me to belive that my Nest mattress has degraded to the point where it not longer provides the proper amount of support for my hips. Upon further investigation, the foam under where I sleep is noticeably softer and less supportive that parts of the mattress which do no get much use. 

I filed a claim with Nest. Nest has some of the worst customer service that I have ever experienced. It took their claims department over 10 days to even respond to my initial claim. They informed me that my warranty claim had been denied because the foam was not sagging 1"". Unfortunately degradation of the foam to the point that it causes pain is not covered. 

I am extremely disappointed that this mattress has only lasted me 3 years. I am also dissappointed that Nest's lifetime warranty only covers sagging which is misleading. After this experience I can no longer recommend Nest Bedding products to friends or family. 

Does anyone have any advice as to where I should go from here? Have I thrown my money down the toilet by buying this mattress?

tl;dr Nest sold me a low quality mattress and is refusing to stand by their product."
"I have found a mattress I like, how do I not get fucked on price?. This is the particular one https://www.serta.com/mattresses/icomfort/hybrid/blue-fusion-1000

"Can you make a mattress softer?. I have a tuft & needle for about 3 years now & when I first purchased it, I loved it. I still do but I had to switch bedframes which definitely made it a lot firmer & I wake up so sore I can barely move. I’m a stomach sleeper & overweight so I don’t exactly have those going for me. Would a topper help? Or a box spring?"
"What brands should I look at for a 6-inch mattress? It needs to fit in a Murphy bed, so I unfortunately can't go thicker.. I have found the lucid brand mattresses and other similar ones on amazon but all the reviews are obviously fake."
"Mattress protector/pad recommendations. I just recently purchased the Winkbeds Plus mattress and have had a for around a week and loving this bed! It’s been great and really supportive. The problem I’m having is with the mattress protector I bought. I bought the Malouf Sleep Tite Five Sided mattress protector with Tencel, thinking this would be great and with the Tencel (I have Tencel sheets and the cover of the mattress has Tencel as well) it would sleep cool. It fits the bed well and definitely waterproof but whenever it’s on the bed, I burn up! It actually doesn’t have much in it at all. I actually got it before I received the new bed and used it on my old mattress to get a feel for it and the same thing. Slept hot on both mattresses! If I take it off the new Winkbed, I never sleep hot and it feels great. 
I’m hoping you all have some recommendations for ones that have worked for you. I don’t have any kids or pets (at the moment) and don’t have any drinks or anything in the bedroom so waterproof isn’t a huge deal. Just want to protect it from stains and dust and all that. I thought about getting just a thin mattress pad, but wasn’t sure if that would be enough."
"200 pound Canadian side sleeper needs mattress advice. Greetings, 

I hail from Toronto, Canada and I need help buying my first real mattress. I’m a 6’2” 200 side  sleeper who has some minor shoulder and back pain at times. Thus, I think a medium firmness bed would be great for me but then again I have no clue what I’m talking about which is why I’m here. 

I have done my own research and every time I come close to a decision I find some contradictory reviews online. I’m hoping to get some advice with my budget being around $1250

I’ve read that bed-in-a-box aren’t great for bigger guys because they use “low foam density” so any advice regarding that would also be appreciated.

Thanks and stay safe.

A man from Canada"
"Kingsdown Duet Hewitt review?. Wanting to upgrade to a king size and really liked the feel of this in store. Anyone have this model? I can’t find many reviews out there. 

Or those familiar with materials if this looks like good value? It was described as a mid-higher end quality by the salesperson.

"Tuft and Needle - Worst purchase ever.. After reading so many positive reviews and seeing the very affordable price tag, I took the plunge and got this T&N original mattress in a queen size. Wow, what a horrible move. 

This mattress isn’t much better than a slab of concrete. And I wake up every morning in so much pain. My back is hurting in places that it has never hurt before, and I have literal bruising on my hips from how hard it is. I wake up constantly through the night practically drowning in my own sweat despite the AC keeping it nice and cool in my apartment. 

I am fully intending to return this mattress and find something else. If anyone has any recommendations or anecdotes about super plushy and affordable beds, I am all ears. 

After several hours of looking, my current contenders are Purple and Silk N Snow."

"Platform Base + Bedroom Set Question. I have purchased a Purple King mattress w/ the platform base and I wanted to confirm that there wouldn't be any issues with getting a bedroom set (headboard/footboard) with this combination.

Is this right?"

"Have a Sealy Hybrid Premium Firm on Order. Couple of Questions.. Hello r/mattress,

I'm 30 years old and I have never been a particularly sound sleeper. I wake up in the middle of the night often, have trouble getting back to sleep, and have very vivid, stressful dreams nearly every night. As such, I never really cared for a ""good night's sleep,"" as I didn't think it was possible for me. I slept on whatever mattress my parents got for me growing up, and bought a cheap mattress when I moved out. I relocated for work about a year ago, and didn't move my furniture. I have slept on an air mattress for literally one year since moving. I decided that in renewing my lease, I might as well buy a bed. I liked the Sealy Hybrid Premium, and ordered one through Mattress Firm after laying on it for a couple of minutes.

My questions; I see a lot of mixed reviews on the mattress, generally positive, and I can't find much on this mattress on reddit. Some people complain of back pain or whatever after using it for a few months, but most say it is the among the most comfortable mattresses they've ever owned. Does anyone have direct experience with this mattress? For someone who is not a mattress connoisseur, should this be sufficient? I'd imagine that after sleeping on an air mattress for a year, anything would seem an improvement. Finally, this mattress was roughly $2k. I know comfort is subjective, but am I way off in terms of general quality and longevity in this price range? Eager to hear your thoughts on it, thanks all."
"Leesa Legend?. Has anybody had any positive or negative experiences with this mattress? Don't see many posts about it. Leesa still running a good Memorial Day Sale to get the King version down to about $2k. Curious if it's worth the extra over the Hybrid, or is a Purple 3 worth the extra couple hundred bucks?"

"It's frustrating. Why don't people spend more money on a better mattress.. There are some amazing mattresses over the $3,000 price range but most people think a quality mattress will between $500 and $1,000. This is the thing you spend most of your life sleeping on. Why do people not have a problem financing a car just to drive it one hour a day but won't finance a great quality bed. It boggles the mind. You can get a top notch bed with 0% interest and keep your payments under $100 a month."
Bear Pro Mattress. Seems like a fairly new mattress and haven't found many reviews on it. Anyone have one? For how long? Pros? Cons? Liking it? (Looking for a king memory foam w/ medium firmness).
"New mattress is disappointing, how can we help make it firmer?. Bought a Natural Latex Hybrid mattress from Nest Bedding last Fall in the medium. Mistake, too soft, but the company was nice enough to send us the firm foam insert that goes on top. STILL too soft, and this is coming from someone who's not really that picky. Used for several months thinking I'd get used to it but it actually feels like it's getting worse.

Messaged Nest Bedding, they said that there's no way to make it more firm. I'm calling bull. The top foam insert is 3 inches wide. Is there any brand out there that makes a 3(ish) foam topper that would help firm up this bed? I'm pretty frugal with my money, this was a BIG fancy purchase for me and it's bad enough that I'm about ready to sell it and take a huge loss."

"Considering Snuggle-Pedic Queen Size Mattress. Anyone have any experience with this brand?. In the market for a new mattress and the Snuggle-Pedic caught my eye.

My girlfriend and I tend to be side sleepers, but I flip around between back and stomach as well. We're both pretty average size (5'9"" and 5'5"" I'd estimate, not overweight).

Our current mattress is an old tempur pedic, but she's never really liked it. I got it for $300 from a Big Lots in 2007 so we're definitely overdue and probably have some damage to repair on our backs.

What stood out to me is that it was developed by a chiropractic doctor, will supposedly offer good support for our back and side sleeping, and will be nice and cool in the summer. However, for all I know the guy could be a quack, the mattress might give out after a year, or there might be some other issues I might not have considered. I don't see this brand mentioned too much on review sites like sleep science either.

Does anyone have experience with this brand of mattress? Would you say it's a good purchase for our needs?

Our budget is somewhere between $1000 to $1300. Thank you for any advice you might be able to give."
"Protector/encasement? Kids and pets and allergies, oh my.. Just ordered a 2 sided pillowtop, very excited and can't wait for it to arrive.  I do want to protect it from liquids, and me from dust allergies.  Looking for recommendations for a protector that won't add heat, I'm thinking that could be a problem with waterproof covers."
"Topper recommendation needed for stomach sleeper.. My wife is a stomach sleeper. Recently we bought a new mattress (firm top innerspring), and we are looking for a decent memory foam topper.

The problem is our current 4"" memory foam (2.3 lb density) topper seems to let her upper body sink, but not her hips. This is leading to back pain, and she said she doesn't feel like her spine is aligned.

She says she wants a very plush topper, but I suspect a medium memory foam topper might provide a little more even support.

I'm thinking a slightly denser 3.5 lb topper might offer more even support without being too firm for her. I'm also wondering if we should stay with 4"" or drop down to a 3"" topper.

Any advice would be appreciated."
"[Canadian] Recommendations for lower back pain. Hey guys, looking for any input on getting a king tailored towards lower back pain/large frame.

Casper UK. Why are all mattresses in every size sold out on the Casper UK site? I've read reports of them laying off staff and downsizing their EU division. Could this be them taking focus from Europe/UK or is there a possibility they're bringing over the new US range to the UK?
"Non-Down Pillow Recommendations. I recently bought a Bear Hybrid that I absolutely love, and I bought two different fill down pillows from Costco shortly before. I was always under the impression that they are the best/most comfortable. Wrong! They leave me with an achy and sore neck pretty often. I guess I move the pillow around when sleeping, it lumps up, and all neck support is gone. I sleep on my back, side, and stomach regularly and these down pillows don’t seem to be fitting the bill very well. 

I’ve been looking at the Purple pillows (mainly for the 100 night trial and the adjustability, but I’m not dead set on them. I like having one side and one back sleeper pillow, so I will probably need two pillows. I also like soft and cradling pillows over the harder memory foam types.

Any other recommendations that have trial periods without a bunch of fine print stipulations?"
"Cloud like mattress?. Hi everyone, I’ve been searching for a mattress for a while now and can’t seem to find the right one online! Like a lot of folks, I’m feeling super overwhelmed by all the choices online. 

I’m looking for a queen mattress that’s preferably at or under $1300. I’d like something that feels like a cloud and something that will last me around 10 years. I think I prefer some sort of memory foam mattress because I’ve have terrible experiences with spring mattresses in the past. I’ve looked into purple, Casper, tuft and needle, yoga bed, etc and the reviewers are super mixed so I’m not sure what the right choice is. I’m pretty much open to any brand out there as long as it feels like a cloud and meets the requirements mentioned above. Also with quarantine, I’m not sure if I’ll actually be able to go into stores any time soon to try out the mattress. For reference, I weight about 115 lbs and live in the states. 

Anyone have any good suggestions? Thanks!!"

"Avocado vs. Tuft & Needle vs. Casper. Looking for some input as I can’t decide on which mattress. I’m average weight, and generally a stomach/side sleeper. Struggle with hip/back pain so leaning towards a firmer mattress. I’ve been reading up on the scary “ingredients” in mattress (fire retardants, material treatments, etc) so I would like to go as natural as possible. That’s why I’m leaning towards Avocado, but not sure comfort wise if it’s solid. I’ve never tried a latex foam before"
"Back pain? Soft vs firm? Box vs $$. Alright all, money be not the object - If you suffered chronic back pain - are you supposed to be buying soft or firm?
I’m considering a hybrid and would normally lean towards firm.
Then we go down the rabbit whole. Leesa looks good, but seems some people are disappointed after a year.
Tempurpedic - I’ve never owned one and would be hesitant to go all foam. Would I want a hybrid?
Considering side and stomach sleepers, with back pain - do we want foam? Hybrid?
Hoping to order this weekend during sales!"
"Attn: stomach sleepers. Please stop sleeping on your stomach. It is one of the primary causes of backpain. 

When you sleep on your stomach, the spine is forced into an unnatural position. This does not feel immediately bad but as the night goes on the muscles, ligaments and discs in your back and hips are forced to work because of the unnatural position your spine is in. This pain will become a bigger issue as we get older.

I am certain there are stomach sleepers out there who never experience pain. I am equally certain those people are in the minority. If you sleep on your stomach and wake up with pain, your odds of finding a mattress that can solve this are almost nil.

"Having to buy mattress sight unseen. Casper Original 2015 VS Casper Wave Hybrid. TLDR: debating getting Casper original (would cost us $216) or Casper Wave Hybrid (would cost us $1722) sight unseen. no sleep trial, no returns, strictly due to their warranty policy\*

Need help- because we are doing a warrantee exchange, we don't get a 100 sleep trial. We don't get a sleep trial at all - so trying to make the best decision as we will be stuck with it.  We live in California, so everything is closed due to COVID, and being at high risk for complications, we are sheltering at home even after stuff opens up so we cannot go try out mattresses in person.

We currently have a 2015 Casper, that is being replaced, it's an all-foam mattress. This is the only Casper we have felt.

We are getting a warrantee exchange so we are sticking within Casper. (yes I know there are lots of other others out there, but we have liked our current old school Casper for years until recently, it has lost a lot of its support, and I'm sure that due to aging fabrics, but its no longer offering the support that it did before so we are changing... We are debating if we should just stick with the same model (even though the \*same\* model is slightly different now, due to updates) or if we should pay the difference to switch to a WAVE HYBRID. From my research online, the WAVE HYBRID is supposed to offer targeted zones due to the gel pods in the hip area, supposed to be cooler? (I have a weighted blanket that claims that its a cooling fabric, but once my body heats it up, it holds heat, so it ends up being hotter than my non-cooling weighted blanket)  Here's some info about us. I weight 250 lbs 5'8, large chest, stomach sleeper- I would love to have more give in the mattress to sink in better around the chest area.  Partner is 250 lbs 6'2, has degenerative disc disease, he is a side sleeper, who needs low back support, comfy on arms, shoulder area. We have an adjustable powered Tempurpedic base frame that we use sometimes, both options are OKed for use with an adjustable base, so this was just extra info. We are also looking into getting a COOLER water system mattress topper from Chili to help keep up cooler at night. Our city has many 100 degrees and up days and so even with the AC running it gets warm, we sleep hot, but I'm seeing that it's probably in large part due to the fact that we are big people sleeping on a foam only bed, so it just helps to trap in heat.

any tips, helpful suggestions totally appreciated."
"Latex medium mattress or hard with soft comfort layer?. Hi, I’d like some help deciding between two latex mattresses I saw in a showroom. I’m wondering what you might recommend given I have neck and back pain. I’m a back and side sleeper and 5’7”/130 pounds. 

The first is a 6 inch medium Dunlop mattress, 85kg/m3. This one doesn’t come with a comfort layer. 

The second is a 6 inch hard Dunlop mattress with a 3 inch soft Dunlop comfort layer.  

They both felt comfortable to me when I was there so I’m having a hard time deciding. At first glance, the second mattress seems similar to a previous latex mattress that I had and loved, but since I don’t have the exact specifications for each, I can’t accurately compare. I wonder whether the first might be too hard for side sleeping or the second might not provide enough support for back sleeping.

In terms of support and feel long term, can anyone comment on how these might compare? Will they both feel like a medium? Do I need a comfort layer? Is a 3-inch soft layer too thick or just right?

For reference these are Getha mattresses, specifically the Nature First and the Getha 99, respectively. I was searching locally as I’m located in Korea. If anyone has other latex mattress suggestions that might be accessible here, please let me know."
"Serta Perfect Sleeper 14"" Ultra Plush Hybrid Mattress ???. So I unfortunately need to go mattress shopping amidst this pandemic and thus cannot try out the mattresses at local stores. I am not very sure what I want in terms of firmness but I prefer plush pillow like feeling. I have had a very bad experience with a Bob-o-pedic memory foam mattress where the fire retardant layer of fiberglass spread throughout the room causing me to throw everything out and here we are. My budget is preferably $500-800 for a queen but can stretch to a max of $1000 if its worth it.  So far I am leaning towards this Serta perfect sleeper on sale for memorial day weekend. I would be getting it for around $600 so it seems like a good deal to me. Does anyone have experience with this particular brand or model? Any help is greatly appreciated!  Here is the link for it

"Advice on first mattress for my BF and I. Hello! 

My BF and I are moving into a new apartment and for the first time we will have to bring our own furniture. We are looking for a queen bed but aren't exactly sure what we want. In the past few years, we've gotten used to sleeping on a particular feeling mattress. In college, we both had 3 "" memory foam mattress toppers over the school-provided twin XL matresses. When we moved off campus, we moved into a furnished apartment that provided a mattress similar to that provided by the dorms, but it was a full size mattress and was thicker. Again, we bought a 3"" memory foam topper. We both have slept very well using the mattress toppers on these mattresses (I'm guessing they are super firm innerspring?). Taking into account price as well as durability, should we simply attempt to buy a super firm innerspring mattress and another 3"" to go on top, or would it be a better investment to buy a mattress that has a built in memory foam topper? Any suggestions for mattresses are welcome. Thank you for your help!"
"Please help a mattress idiot. (Kind of funny mattress experience itt). Hi everyone. I seem to like to buy cheap mattresses thinking I'm getting a good deal (giant brain obviously) or saving money, but then they quickly suck and I'm back at square one. I think I've been through 5 or 6 mattresses in the last 10 years. 

I'm 6'1, 190lb. 

The most recent I bought at a local ""discount mattress"" store that has good reviews. The guy was nice, honest, helpful, and the delivery service was great...But I still feel like I bought a POS at insane markup. Hey, it happens. I even did a ""comfort exchange"" so this is the second mattress I tried from this store. 

So that's two in the last year and a half. The first was an ""mlily"" hybrid, and the current one is I believe a ""primo'. It's basically 9"" hard foam and 3"" memory foam, very firm. I said I wanted a very hard mattress, and I guess I got what I wanted. Turns out I did NOT want a very hard mattress. I added a 2"" sleep on latex medium topper and its significantly better, but it just has a weird combination feel to it. It's hot, I sweat a lot, I sink in an odd way, and it just sucks overall. 

So that's a nice $1,200 L. 

Cut to now. I decided I'm just over this never sleeping well, being in bed a lot but never getting a good nights sleep. So I ordered the Zinus cal king 14"" standard base and one of these (https://www.amazon.com/PrimaSleep-Multi-Layered-Infused-Mattress-California/dp/B071DD8GRT?pf_rd_r=DTBRT34PZWZC40Z665MA&pf_rd_p=4ef03d4f-fc52-4cba-b905-5ea280a737fe&pd_rd_r=f462cc6d-c147-4ec1-9c17-091f59fb3e0a&pd_rd_w=8Awg3&pd_rd_wg=NjGKo&ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_d) 

Again, thinking I am a giant brain, getting a new bed for $350 shipped. EH....

So then the mattress takes forever to ship, I come on this subreddit and do a little digging. See some posts from people clearly in the know, and decide I should actually spend some money and get a good bed. So I cancelled the order for that very well reviewed $280 foam slab and started looking at better options. 

So here are my top options. I am looking for a medium / soft. Something supportive, but soft, if that makes sense. I don't mind splurging - I just want the best I can afford which for now is probably like 2k. 

I really like the Brentwood line, at least their marketing. I like that they seem to use high quality materials and are made in the US / 
CA. 
Brentwood Crystal Cove: 
https://www.brentwoodhome.com/products/crystal-cove-mattress

CA King - $1,350 shipped after discounts, pre tax.

I like that it's made in the US, seemingly of high quality materials.
I like that it has 1400 coils for this size, even though I really have no clue if thats good or even relevant? Comparing it to their other models like the new hybrid latex, it has significanty more coils (1,384 vs 958)
 I like that it's double sided and offers a firm and plush option since I clearly can never make up my mind. Is this a total gimmick? 

Brentwood Hybrid Latex https://www.brentwoodhome.com/products/hybrid-latex-mattress?variant=31877132058686
CA King - $1,040 shipped pre tax with BWPERKS code. 

I like a lot about this one. I love latex and wool, and their unique zone tech foam looks pretty cool. Idk, just seems like a pretty great bed for $1000. Thoughts? It's new and there aren't any reviews, but that doesn't really worry me. 

Cedar Natural Luxe -$1,440 shipped pre tax https://www.brentwoodhome.com/products/cedar-natural-luxe-mattress?variant=18602823680062

Not much to really say. Looks very nice. My concern here is that it's a pretty thin level of latex? 

Sleep on latex: 
8"" medium Cal King - $1,200 pre tax shipped.

Usually the 8"" would scare me. But I have their 2"" topper currently, and I've always thought two of them together would make a fine mattress. I'm sure the 8"" is plenty. I love these guys style. Simple, quality materials. Consumer reports recommends it, and they ship very quickly. Seems like a pretty safe bet.

Costco Novaform Serafina medium -  $700 
Heard a lot good things about this one, price is good... Maybe a bit cheap? Not that thats the deciding factor, but I don't want to cheap out and be in the same spot in a year.  

Tempurpedics from costco - $1700-2,000. I feel like these go on sale regularly, so full price is meh, but I could return it or price match down the line. Tempurpedic. Quality. All that. But I've heard they aren't as good as they used to be. 

I don't know man. Clearly I'm all over the place. ANY help is greatly appreciated. I just want to sleep!"
"What do you guys hate most about mattress review sites?. I’m a writer for a popular mattress review site and my company said I don’t have to hold back at all and can write whatever I want.

I know you guys have had issues with review sites shilling for companies. I’m aware of that and I already wrote an article calling out companies who use fiberglass for example. What other problems do you have with review sites? What do you think review sites are missing so I know what to focus on?

I want to make sure that my writing appeals to people who are actually looking to buy a mattress. What’s the point otherwise, right?

Thanks!"
"Looking for something similar to Beautyrest Black hybrid Amherst Firm and could use some help/recommendations.. Hey guys, so I’m kind of in a bind right now due to my current situation and I have suddenly found myself in need of a new mattress, a bed frame and potentially a foundation. Seeing as I can’t exactly go to a showroom and check mattresses out, I’m looking for one similar to the above. My mom purchased that one in 2016 and I’ve slept on it a few times when I was dog sitting for her. It’s held up incredibly well and it’s just the right level of support and comfort. The trouble is, it seems to have been discontinued and I don’t have any of the specs for it so I don’t even know where to start. 

I’ve read the FAQ and I’ve actually been needing a new mattress for a while, so I’ve already been doing some research, but I do need to get a new one very soon so I figured I would ask here to see if anyone has any recommendations so I don’t spend another week trying to pick one out then another few weeks for delivery. 

Thanks in advance you guys!"
"Replacement for a Leesa for a side sleeper?. So I bought a Leesa like 2 years ago and it was extremely comfortable but the middle foams basically disintegrated, something that I was already noticing 6-9 months after purchasing it, and I have to sleep on the edges to be able to get comfortable at all. It also sleeps a bit hotter than I would like despite the addition of a Layla mattress topper and a cooling mattress protector from Nest Bedding. 

It sucks that this thing fell apart so much because quite frankly I’m disabled on SSDI and can’t afford to be replacing a mattress every other year. It’s also very hard being a side sleeper because my mattresses have to be less firm than most and I’m also not particularly large (6’ with a weight range of 160-200) so it needs to have enough give to not kill my shoulders. When I lie on my back or stomach, I have panic attacks from feeling my heartbeat so side I stay. 

I was looking at Layla but with how quickly the Leesa failed (which apparently was quite common and I can’t help but notice that Leesa made a second generation with new materials now although I haven’t dug into the specs), I am not sure I want to trust another bed in a box deal. 

Going in person to test mattresses can’t happen because I have agoraphobia which makes this whole thing even more frustrating because I was happy and slept better on the Leesa than any mattress I ever had before (exception being when it’s hot outside which I’m starting to have to deal with the 90s we already had in Denver). I just need a twin and ideally under $800 (I’ll have to finance it but I can just ask Discover for a 0% APR and they’ll give it to me for 12 months and if they don’t, I’ll open a new credit card with a 0% APR). 

Thanks in advance! It would be nice to be able to sleep normally again. I have been dealing with lower back pain if I end up rolling in the middle when I’m sleeping. :/"
"Can you put a memory foam mattress on a curved wood slot frame?. Hey all, my wife and I are in need of a new bed frame, as our hand me down frame gave out right after buying a new memory foam mattress. We really like the idea of this curved one type that allows for easy sitting in bed. My wife just gave birth to our first and spend a lot of time sitting up in bed with baby. I've tried doing research but nothing talks about this type of frame. Would it work with memory foam?

"Always been somewhat of an insomniac, but this is just ridiculous. I have trouble sleeping. Always had. Whether it was from the intense brightness from my phone keeping my brain wired, or the inability to sleep by command - it's always been an issue and you could tell just by looking at me. Dark circles under my eyes like something out of Mob of the Dead but I've grown to like the aesthetic look. Thing is, at 19, I've finally been introduced to the defibrillating feeling of your shoulders having a meet-and-greet with your neck.

I'm saving for a new mattress. Always slept on a PoS anything-goes over concrete. Never had a problem falling asleep, it was CONVINCING myself to get in bed that was the problem. But now that my bones feel denser, and after noticing that I can't be careless with my body like a rag-doll, I'm realizing that there's so much more to choosing a mattress than I thought.

I'll just leave it to you guys.. I understand that choosing a comfortable mattress is subjective but if I leave my stats it should narrow it down to at least 10% to choose from.

Budget - 900-1100 CAD (650-800 USD isn't that a bummer.) Not looking for an entire set. I'm willing to DIY whatever. Can't procrastinate if I wake up in pain.

171cm (5'7) 64kg (140lbs) (want some wiggle room so Full seems good in size) (no s/o, I'm 19 gimme a break)

I've tried sleeping on my back because it personally produces a higher success rate for lucid dreaming but it's not my usual position. Side Sleeping's more comfortable.

Problems: Heat. Heat. Heat. I live in Canada. The reputation it gets for how cold it is stands, but when the snow melts I can't fall asleep. I'm worried about July this year.

Whichever shoulder I'm sleeping on wants to poke my neck. The pain dissipates 20 minutes after waking up but if I try to extend either rotator cuff I can feel the symptoms of my current PoS mattress. I used to sleep with my pillow between my shoulder/head but the lack of quality pillows coupled with not enough cushioning from the mattress makes my arm numb after an hour or so and I wake up with the static buzz and I can't move my fingers. Kind of a wake up call.

No back problems.(probably eventually though :P) Just need my hips, shoulders and neck to be aligned. I could probably fix the neck issue with a decent pillow.

Recommendations are nice, but unless you're 5'7 I don't think it'd really work because you've experienced a phenomenal mattress (lucky bastard haha)  Just want a diagnosis for what should be INSIDE the mattress to fix the problems. If anyone's a pro, I know asking for free advice is a common occurrence but I'd give you a hug if I ever met ya.

Thanks.

P.S if I need to spend a little more I'm fine with it. Just need to wait an extra month or two and budget correctly. I'm down. Just no B.S marketing I'm sure there's a decent brand out there with no recognition (**Aureal Semiconductor Inc.** for you audiophiles. R.I.P) "
"Looking for feedback on Purple Mattresses!. Hey guys! I'm in the market for a new mattress and I have a bad back from several injuries. I had a T&N a few years ago and it was pretty comfy, but I'm looking for something that has exceptional airflow as I freaking hate waking up sweaty!

So - looking around with all the companies now (back when I got my Tuft and Needle mattress they were really all there was as far as ship-to-home-memory-foam) this bed seems great, though is really like to hear someone's honest opinion on it. Again, out of the 3 Purple had to offer, I have my eye on the mid-grade for the enhanced cooling and definitely don't want to drop the extra money for the top-tier Purple mattress unless it's absolutely worth it.

Thanks for the read, I'm looking forward to seeing what you guys think of it and I'm ready to pull the trigger on the purchase depending on your guy's feedback! Thanks in advance, sleep comfy, friends!"

"Considering getting a futon. I'm looking to buy a firm 140cm mattress and have considered trying to get a futon. The problem I'm having is not really understanding what's Japanese, what's Western and why it matters.

I believe I tested this one https://www.futonwerk.com/futon-dx3.html and it seemed quite nice. This would cost me approx. $780 which is okay if I get a nice mattress.

However searching Reddit I see a lot of people asking for $100-$200 and wondering what I'm getting here for $780.

Am I wrong when I say this is Western futon mattress? It's approx. 20cm/8"" in height when most Japanese style seems to be 10cm/2"". Does that matter if I don't expect to be rolling mine together but instead just have it on a frame in my bedroom?"

1 inch charcoal-infused memory foam with BioFoam®, 2 inches 1.5/33 foam, 8 inch contour cut 1.5/33 foam.

I’d rather not get rid of a relatively new mattress, but I may have to.  I’m not huge, so it shouldn’t be my size (5’11” and 180 lbs).

My budget was $1000, and these two mattresses seem to best fit my needs. I do have back problems—some lower back pains, but upper back/neck pains as well—so I’d prefer something a bit more firm.

I haven’t tested either of them, so I hope to hear back from your experiences on any of them. The 100-night trial offers some relief, but if I could save myself the trouble, that’d be good.

- Cooling isn’t super important. 
- I’m 5’ 4” at ~140 lb. 
- Mainly a back sleeper, but I sleep on the side every so often.

"How does one go about buying a mattress in quarantine?. I'm curious if anyone is in the same boat as me. I've read the FAQ, buying guides, experiences, but they all depend on doing something that is currently impossible to do: go out and try mattresses.

"ReST 1 year follow-up review. This morning I woke to a message from a fellow redditor asking for my feelings in regard to my ReST mattress now that I've owned it for a year. After answering their questions as best I could, I figured ""what the heck, ill update everyone"", so here that is!

In terms of materials, build quality, and function, there have been no issues. The wifi issue that I originally had has been resolved in an app/firmware update.
I still sleep wonderfully, the pressure distribution works great, and I would have zero hesitation buying another, or recommending one to friends and family.
It's my understanding that they no longer provide tablets with the mattresses, but with everyone having smart phones thats a non-issue I would think.

"Differences between TEMPUR-Adapt and TEMPUR-Support?. Hello guys!

I haven't noticed any major difference when trying out both, however...

I visited two shops. Shop #1 offered me a TEMPUR-Adapt Double for 3000 CAD$ and Shop #2 offered me a TEMPUR-Support Queen with an adjustable foundation for 2700 CAD$ (2100 CAD$ with a non-adjustable foundation).

Again, they seemed very similar, but is there a reason for this price gap? On a very quick note, I'm a hot sleeper with a sensitive back who mostly sleeps on the side.

Also, I guess an adjustable mattress is interesting because I could sleep with my feet up? Is it good?

"Not thrilled with Nest Hybrid Latex, what to do?. I've had my Nest Hybrid Latex in Plush for \~90 days, and I'm not super thrilled with it. While I've generally been sleeping ok, I'm not sure it's supporting me correctly. I feel like my hips sink more than they probably should, and it feels like I'm sinking/stuck especially when sleeping next to my girlfriend. I'm guessing that to some degree I'm probably just realizing I don't like a ""hugging"" mattress as much as I thought, coming from a pure innerspring. I've been having a bit more back pain than I used to, but it's also quite possible it's from my desk chair from working at home recently.

I thought at first that I probably just needed a firmer comfort layer, but now I'm not even sure about that. I removed the latex foam and tried laying on it without *any* comfort layer, and even that seems softer than I'd expect.

My options, as I see them:

* Live with it as-is
* Exchange for a firmer layer (medium? firm?). Pay shipping fee, and Nest return policy expires by the time I get it :-/
* Get a local Oregon Mattress Company mattress I've tried. I was leaning towards this, but there's not many reviews and there are some *terrible* ones online w.r.t. durability and warranty.
* Get another cheap Beautyrest innerspring like I used to have for years"
"What should I get for my partner and me? Our needs are all over the place. I am 5'4'' and fluctuate between 150-170lb and my partner is 5'8'' and 190lbs.

I'm a light sleeper, I toss and turn and often wake up with neck pain. My shoulder joints are loose and tend to sublux in my sleep when I sleep on my side, rendering super firm mattresses a no-go for me.

My partner on the other hand sleeps like a rock and has sciatica which is only relieved by a at least a medium mattress or firmer.

Things we both have in common: 
-Both of us sleep pretty evenly on our backs and sides (although occasionally, I sleep on my stomach.) 
-Both of us run very HOT 
-Both of us want a bed that isn't noisy (-We both would probably benefit from a bed with an adjustable head, as I have acid reflux issues and my partner has snoring issues, so an adjustable base would potentially be nice. However,the only way this would really work is if there were a semi-split configuration like Sleep Number's ""flex"" series since a. we have different height preferences and b. the seam in a full split would drive us nuts. Therefore, I realize this is probably an unrealistic goal.)

We want to upgrade to a king and I was looking into adjustable air beds to cope with our different parameters but for such expensive beds, the mixed reviews I've been reading are not reassuring: so-so/poor longevity, expensive to repair, and sometimes noisy.

I was trying to stay under $2000 but considering you spend 1/3 of your life sleeping, I'm willing to shill out a maximum of $5000 for a perfect bed.

But with all of the choices out there, I'm at a loss and feeling overwhelmed. I've been searching for days and don't feel any closer to making a decision. Any advice would be welcome!"

Where do you find a bed frame for a mattress+foundation???. Got a new mattress and foundation coming next week and am looking for new bed frame for it.

"Feeling overwhelmed buying a mattress online. I've looked at the FAQ I've looked at mattress underground and I feel farther away from chosing a mattress than when I started.

I'm 5'10"" 165lbs 26 years old. I typically fall asleep on my side but wake up on my stomach. For the majority of the past 14 years I've slept on the same traditional mattress. I am looking to upgrade to a king size bed.

From testing some friends mattresses I know I do not like incredibly soft or incredibly firm mattresses I like a good amount of support.

My budget is $2500. I want something comfortable that I can hope to have for 8-12 years.

I bought a frame similar to this one. Cannot find the actual one now.

At first I figured I would go with purple because of thier aggressive marketing. After reading around online Im not sure what to think. Mattress stores in my area are currently shutdown.

Can anyone offer me some advice?

Additionally I snore and often wake up with a stuffy nose. Should I be looking at adjustable mattresses? Would that even be compatible with my frame?"

"Anybody ever ""repaired"" a Sleep Number bed?. We've had a Sleep Number bed for... forever.
My wife loved it in the beginning.  I love my wife.
Now, it's agony for her to sleep on it, it isn't firm enough for her, although she has her side set on 100 (she used to keep it at 60).

I don't remember how old the bed is... probably more than 10 years.  I don't know what model.  I barely know the size.  

I think I know the problem, but I'm not sure how to fix it.

Over the years, I think that the foam-ish ""tray"" that the bladders sit in has deteriorated.  The sides of the bed extend past the rigid base a few inches on either side.  No side constraints, no way for the mattress to hold it's firmness.
And, some years ago, I probably tore the bottom fabric that held the sides together, on her side.  I think that over the years, with her sitting on the edge of the bed getting dressed, preparing for bed, whatever, it has caused the sides or bottom fabric to weaken.

On the Sleep Numbers site, they don't have any parts information, so I can't just go an order a Part P-71-tray-fitting or whatever it would be.

I would rather try to repair it than spend $1k+ for whatever the favorite mattress that all of the trendy kids have now.

Has anybody ever repaired their SN bed - especially, the thing that the air bladders sit in?

Any ideas?  Any one?  Any one?  Beuhler?  Beuheler?

Thank you"
"Cheaper Beautyrest Eurotop vs Alexander Nest Hybrid? Splurge or save?. Hey all—I’m a lightweight side sleeper in the market for a new soft mattress. The Beautyrest BR800 Plush Euro top on mattress firm seems to have good edge support, and, while there aren’t a whole lotta reviews on YouTube, the reviews on the website seem good. The bed is on sale for like $450 (usually ~$700). However, I’m worried about the durability & the return policy since I can’t try it out first. Alternatively, I’ve been looking at the Nest Alexander Signature Hybrid medium mattress. It looks really luxurious, the foam quality is high, and the return/exchange policy is good. The edge support might not be quite as good. However the Nest bed is $1200 with a coupon. I’m just having trouble wrapping my head around paying over twice the price for the Nest one...can it really be worth that much more?"
"Sleep EZ Roma Mattress versus Latex Mattress Factory Naturale. I have been researching mattresses for a while now and \*think\* I have it narrowed down to the Sleep EZ Roma or the Latex Mattress Factory Naturale. In terms of the latex components, I think they are pretty similar. The Roma has 3"" of medium dunlop and 3"" of firm dunlop and finished on both sides with a quilted cover that includes 1.5"" foam. The Naturale has 6"" firm dunlop and 2"" soft talalay. The cheaper price point of the Roma ($912 versus $1,092 for the king size) is appealing (plus they come with free pillows and mattress protector), but I am less excited about the foam in the top layer. I have read on Mattress Underground that I don't need to be concerned about the durability of this layer since it is pretty thin. It also seems to me that the soft side of the Naturale (it is designed to be flippable) is likely a bit softer than the Roma would be, but both seem like they would be suitable for us (130#/160#, side>back sleepers). **Does anyone have experience with one/both and would be willing to share their experiences? Moreover, for anyone that has had the Roma Mattress, I am curious whether the foam top layer significantly alters the otherwise latex feel of the mattress?**"

"Comfort Dreams fiber issue - FXI. I have been having an issue with a mattress called “Comfort Dreams” that I ordered on Overstock.com (manufactured by FXI) just over a year ago. I have recently noticed that the mattress has been shedding tiny shiny fibers that are getting all over my apartment. The fibers are only visible when under direct bright light. The only way they are visible is when they reflect the direct light. 

I have contacted FXI customer service, but they have not been very helpful. They have only told me that their products don’t contain fiberglass. However, from what I have read, these fibers look like fiberglass.

Has anyone else had a similar issue with this mattress or others?"
"Need a cooling mattress. So. I (23f) and the other half (29m) are looking for a cooling mattress. We currently have the Muse queen sized, we've had it for about a month.

Preferences: can range from soft to medium firm. Noticing more lately that I’m having some shoulder pain so hopefully a softer mattress will help? Im thinking about changing my bed frame tho to one of those metal platform beds that can fold up that wouldn’t require slats or a box spring.

Also mold might be an issue since I have very poor ventilation and I live in a perpetually foggy climate, so any tips to help prevent mold is very much appreciated!!"
"Bed Suggestions - Couple - Queen - Around $1k USD.   

Hey everyone so my wife and I have been using random mattresses throughout both our lives. We know very little but wanted to look into getting a new mattress anyway. We’ve been using a traditional full bed for the last couple years, which we thought was a queen (shows how much we know ?). It’s not preferable to get one online, but we don’t really want to wait for COVID to be over to get something. I think we’re looking for something that’s either just foam or a hybrid. I weigh about 280 lbs (6’4”) and she weighs about 180 (5’3). Slightly overweight. We’re trying to find something decent for around $1k, but I would ideally add in a box spring or frame with it.  I’ve read through some suggestions and ended up looking at a few different sites. 

I’m a little intimidated by some of the posts/guides about the quality foam vs. cheap foam and such. I definitely want something denser so it will last longer (I understood that at least), but at the same time I don’t want something that will “cook” us. I don’t think we’re particularly “hot” sleepers or anything, but some cooling would be nice. That’s why I was thinking maybe a hybrid would be best. Any recommendations? I think queen is more practical for our price range, opposed to a king. I’m still looking at mattresses online, but figured I’d ask here.

So for my newbie specs:

Support for larger people

Durable/long lasting

Price range: $500-$1,200 (with box spring or some sort of foundation included)

Foam or hybrid (I think)

Not sure, but plush does sound nice. I’ve never had a topper part on my mattress like that (no pillow top or plush or anything) so I don’t think we’d miss it. 

Primarily side sleepers trying to avoid aches/pains when we wake up.

Preferably a softer mattress. Not sure if this is wise, but we’ve always had firm and are envious of people with softer mattresses.

Costco:

Seems like their cheaper options are really bad. There is always going to be some bad review though so I’m trying to take that with a grain of salt.

Sam’s club:

Sam’s club wasn’t really recommended, but I figured I’d check. Seems to be relatively similar to Costco.

Nectar mattress: 

$799 (No foundation included)

Purple Mattress:

$999 (No foundation included)"
"How long to decide before a mattress isn’t for you?. I chose a Muse Medium Mattress after months of hunting for the right bed. I am a lightweight side sleeper that’s relatively short and sleep very hot. With all the cooling features and lack of motion transfer and good for side sleepers, I figured this bed would be good for me. 

After 4 hours of sleep, I woke up sweating profusely and could not fall back asleep. I have brand new 100% cotton sheets - it does have a sateen finish but I don’t think that’s the problem. I woke up with a lot of shoulder pain and could not fall back asleep on the bed so I went into the other room where my old mattress was so I could sleep. 

The left side after 48 hours is still curling upwards and the bed still hasn’t inflated properly (it’s very different softness levels all over the bed) 

Muse does have a returns process but I wanted to gauge how long I should wait to see if this bed is for me?"
"Purple mattress 2, I think it has injured me.. Just over a year ago, my wife and I got the purple bed 2. As someone who has had a back injury and has been in and out of physical therapy many times, I thought that this would be a good purchase. At first the bed was nice and I slept fairly well, but I still woke up extremely stiff, but I thought that I would just give it some time to break in. Most days when I wake up, I notice that my pelvis hurts like it was being crushed all night (I had this same issue with the first purple pillow, at first the pillow was extremely comfortable and I fell asleep quick, but when I would wake up it would feel like I had been pressing my ears against a concrete wall, it hurt that bad), I attributed it to weak hip and back muscles for the pain and did not think much of it. About a month ago I noticed that my pelvis on both sides were hurting, but my right side was in severe pain.     

A couple weeks ago, my pain has gotten so bad that now I cannot even bend over to touch my toes without excruciating pain, I cannot even do the stretch where you sit on the floor, put one leg in and one leg out. I am someone with an extremely high pain tolerance, events in my life has lead me to that point, I do not wince or complain about pain that most people do, but this has been the absolute worst pain I have endured in my life so far. The socket where my femur and pelvis connect feels like it is just crushed, and my lower right side on the same line where the pelvis is feels like I have been cut with a knife. I have consulted with my doctor already and now I have go back on muscle relaxers and other pain meds to manage the pain and even then it still hurts. I never ahd this issue with my leesa bed, even though the leesa bed I still have bad back pain, I never felt like my hips were repeatedly hit with a hammer. My wife who does not have back pain or any muscular issues like I do has been telling me lately that her hips have been in pain as well. 

The reason why I really think the purple bed has hurt me is because like I said earlier about the purple pillow. The special material they use is nice and feels good for some time, but eventually it becomes painful. I am now thinking about buying a new mattress but I do not even know what I need (if anyone has suggestions for a good mattress for my issue, I would appreciate it)."
"Final attempt for mattress search... Is Latex the answer?!. Hi,

I'm frustrated.

I have been on a mattress search for over 4 months now. I have put a ton of research in which half of it consists of sifting through trustworthy sources. I am quite frustrated with the process and just haven't found the mattress for me. I am beginning to think there isn't one! I have started my research in latex now. I'll give you a little summary of how my process has gone so far.  
About me:  
Male, 5'11', 175lbs, athletic build, mostly side sleeper but toss and turn a lot, right shoulder constantly has pain only when laying on it. Often wake up with pain in the right shoulder and overall tightness across up back/chess that i need to slowly roll/stretch out causing creaks and pains.... I'm only 26.

  
I have tried 2 beds: The Bear Hybrid (returned as it was slightly too firm) and Nest Alexander Hybrid Medium (currently sleeping on). Both feel and seem like quality mattresses. I looked over guides and they appear to exceed requirements based on foam and coil quality. I was so confident that the Nest would be my dream bed. After a couple weeks, that shoulder comfort just wasn't there. I reached out to Nest and they sent me a 3"" comfort layer in Plush. The bed has the zipper top feature which is amazing and seems like a great investment as I can always swap whatever I want in there. After trying the plush layer, the shoulder pain was relieved but man was I out of alignment. I felt my hips sinking and my body just felting unsupported and twisting like a pretzel. I eventually tried sleeping across my bed since they are split foams. I can have one side plush, one side medium, or all of the same firmness. The foams go length-wise so that's why I slept across the bed. This just felt odd. I'm sure it was mainly because the zones weren't lining up but I just felt uneven and it was extremely noticeable. I am now exploring other options..  
I really like the idea of less is more in mattresses. It seems like all mattresses these days offering all of these fancy transition layers and blah blah. I am starting to think a 3 layer latex bed may be worth a try. I do enjoy a softer bed but not like the plush I tried from Nest. The medium is really nice I just can't do the shoulder pain. I have tried to force myself to sleep on my back but it is such a hard habit to break. Eventually I'd like to get there.   
Here is my idea: I do think the Nest is a great bed. And the zipper top has me thinking... maybe a soft 3"" Talalay Latex would be the ticket? But it leads to a common point; the mattress is only as strong as its weakest link. In that case, if I was able to get a 3"" Talalay layer, how would it bode with the rest of the mattress? Here is the construction of the Nest:  
Bottom to top:  
1"" 3lb Base Support Foam called HR (High Resiliency), they claim HR is better than HD  
8"" Quantum Edge Pocketed Support Coils (816 coil count) This might be based on a queen size, i have a king  
1"" 3lb Smart Flow Support Foam   
3"" 3.5lb - 4lb TitanChil Endurance Foam (The range is based on firmness levels. This is the section of foam that is swap able when unzipping the top)  
.4"" 4lb. Luxury Memory Foam  
.1"" Super Soft Quilted Thermic Phase Change (These last two layers are in the zipper top section)  
To me, it seems like it would be a quality build to throw 3"" of Talalay in the comfort layer. 

I have been looking into the Coronado mattress from Mattressmakers.com  
Also, I have an adjustable base if that plays into any of your thoughts.

"Brought a new latex bed, should I be concerned about covid?. I brought a twin mattress online a month ago. It shipped 2 weeks ago and going to from Arizona to New Mexico, to Chicago to nyc(last stop). Should I be worry about covid?"
"Does anyone have any experience with the Idle Sleep Latex Hybrid or the company itself?. I’m considering trying the Talalay version of the hybrid. I can get it for 35% off with 0% financing for 60 mo. and get 7.5% cash back. They have a 18 mo. trial period and limited lifetime warranty covering sags or indents over 1”. Most of the online reviews are for the Dunlap version. I was wondering if anyone has any experience with Idle Sleep, good or bad."
"Mattress Firm is the biggest joke of a company I have ever experienced in my life.. So, I order a mattress online. I choose a delivery date. They don't show, don't call, nothing. I try calling their customer service number, there is literally no way to talk to a person, they tell you email is the only way to contact them. Their online chat feature does not have any real people either. 

I email their customer service, tell them that I want to cancel. Get no response after a few days. So I complain on twitter. Get a call from someone in corporate the next day.  The person from corporate convinces me to reschedule instead of cancel the order, says they'll send me a new pillow. So i reschedule for a couple of weeks out (apparently they didn't have that particular mattress in stock, which is fine, but they could have simply told me that instead of making me waste a whole saturday waiting).

So a few days after this, I get a response from the original CS email I sent. It was just a generic email saying my order to cancel was being processed. I sent another email to CS, tell them that after talking to corporate, I decided not to cancel.  A few days later, I get the same generic cancellation email. So I send *another* email basically telling them the same thing.  A few days later I get another email saying my refund is being processed. So I go back to twitter, explain to them the situation in DM's,  get a response back saying that the order was still scheduled for the 2nd delivery attempt.  And of course what happens? No mattress, no phone call, no nothing.  

Go back to twitter,  send a DM,  get told that the situation has been sent to someone in corporate.  That was 6 days ago.  I respond back to the DM a couple of days ago for some kind of update, but now they are ignoring my DM's and tweets.

Worst company I have ever interacted with in my entire life. How does a company that is this utterly incompetent become successful? They stand me up 2 different times, waste 2 days out of my life, and then don't even call me to reschedule, and go out of their way to make sure that it's not possible to contact a human being?

Fuck Mattress Firm."
Any Memorial Day promotions we should watch out for?. 
"Can I store a full-size spring mattress on its side for two months in a basement?. I'll wrap it in 1 or 2 plastic mattress bags, of course, but I'm wondering if this is just a recipe for disaster. Online sources say never to store mattresses on their sides, but I won't have a choice given the size of the basement and the fact that other people are already using it to store items. I doubt it's fully climate controlled, and it's about to get pretty hot/humid here in the midwest ... But if it's only until August 1st, do we think it'll come out of storage relatively unharmed? It's this or buy a new mattress that I'll probably only own for 9 months before I move again in summer 2021."
"Head spinning. Tuft and needle or lull?. Gone over what feels like 100 different mattress in a box companies and 10,000 reviews.

Hoping someone has an opinion about either or those options... Thanks."

I'm worried about the mattress's general longevity, and their customer service. Just trying to get general questions answered from them has been a little bit annoying. 

Does anyone have a review of their nest bed after multiple years? Good? Bad? I don't exactly have 1,500 to spend every year when a mattress doesn't last. They keep talking about their ""comfort guarantee"" but I just don't want to waste my time on a short term mattress.

"Tempur ProAdapt Hybrid vs. Purple 3. Looking for some opinions because I don’t think I can read another online review without changing my mind. Again.

Husband and I are looking for a king size mattress. We had a Sealy posture pedic hybrid for 6 years but has some major sagging. I want something that’ll last beyond that and willing to spend more to get it. We did love the feeling of the hybrid.

Husband - 6’ and 275, starts on his back but flips to his side a lot.

Me - 5’5” and 215, mostly side sleeper, sometimes stomach.

We like a firmer feel and no sinking. I sleep hot and hate feeling trapped in a mattress. A mattress store recommended these 2 but I’d love opinions on both or recommendations on something you this is better.

I have never slept on latex before. Always slept on crap, wife and I want something nice before our baby is due. Mattress retailers in my area (Las Vegas) only have mattresses with 1/4""-1"" of latex. Was looking at Purple but it seems kinda gimmicky.

"Mattress? Mattress toppers?. I'm planning to move out sometime after everything calms down but the more I look into beds, the more confused I get. Not too sure what a bed really needs.

I have 2 big concerns regarding mattresses, 1st is that I'm prone to low back pains so if I'm sleeping on a bad bed, I could get back pain so bad that I wouldn't be able to move. The 2nd is that I'm not very strong and in case I don't have friends/family nearby to call for help, I'm worried about being able to haul my bed stuff when I move around. 

I like the look of platform beds, so I'll probably aim for a platform and now I just need the mattress. After some research, I'm thinking of getting a good thin-ish mattress (maybe a 3-5""? I think there's a 3"" in ikea) and top it off with a mattress topper (maybe 2-3""?) to provide extra padding? Is a thin mattress + topper a bad idea? Honestly, I don't know what makes up a quality bed so I'd definitely need some advice."
"Mattress commission plan. So I am opening up another store and was reaching out to my follow Reddit community as to what they feel is the best pay plan as far as commission. Should I offer a flat rate or sliding scale. I was thinking minimum wage PLUS 5% of all gross sales up to $10K in sales. 10K to 30K in gross sales and it goes to 7% and after 30K a month its 10% of gross sales. So for example salesperson sells 20K in sales they get their minimum wage plus $1,400. I was then thinking every 10K tier after 30K in sales they get $500 plus their commission and hourly pay. So as an example He or she writes $50K in sales they get hourly(Let's say 2K) plus commission at 10% would be 5K and two $500 bonuses so total compensation for month would be $8,000 for the month on 50K in written sales. What do you guys think about that and if you work at a mattress store please let me know your pay structure."
"We sleep on a woolen spike strip. Help!. Sorry for the ridiculous thread title - wanted to cram as much info in as possible but, still only scratches surface. My girlfriend and I are both bigger - me (31m) about 290lbs and her (29f) about 240lbs right now in lockdown & off diets/packing on those pandemic pounds. We both have respiratory conditions, so we're in full quarantine and thus limited to online shopping/ordering. Problem is - our budget is around $1200 (we had planned to spend like $800, then we started shopping and reality set in), $1500 tops for King with frame/foundation/box spring and protector is what I'm looking to find now. No real preference in material - we just want something soft that will support us and sleep cool with good spinal alignment.

For reference: as of now we're literally on a Queen mattress that's been destroyed for years. It's got numerous springs poking through. As a pillow top, it can't be flipped. It's completely bowed in on both sides. This isn't from weight - bed we have now served as our only piece of furniture for several years in a bad living situation. We now have our own place and furniture to sit on, so this is just for sleep and sex now. If our bed wasn't so horrific that we have to keep the comforter underneath it for protection from direct spring pokes, I'd wait until I could test a bed. But I cannot. ? ?? ? ???  


Titan seems to meet \*almost\* all my requirements and hers but one major issue - neither of us like a firm matress. We both like as plush as possible to support heavier people. Purple looks perfect but is too expensive. We're both primarily side sleepers, occasional back but mostly side. We both sleep hot. We've both been much healthier and hope to at some point get down closer to ~200lbs again, we had already been off our diet since the holidays when corona hit, but eventually when things change I especially fear how firm the Titan might be if we did lose weight again, as it sounds far too firm for us now. Regardless - I wanna find something that'll be comfortable & supportive for us now, sleeps cool, good for spinal alignment, in our budget, and not something that's only gonna stay extra comfy if we stay extra chunky.

People of r/mattress: please help us sleep like humans!"
Can anyone recommend mattresses that are good for lower back pain but also budget-friendly?. 
"Bought a new generic brand memory foam mattress, as a result I can’t help but sleep +12 hours daily. I feel very comfortable, as if I am floating when I’m sleeping. But when I wake up, I just want to sleep more and more. Thoughts? How can I stop this cycle?. "
"Looking for mattress recommendations, that can be purchased online.. Hi all, I’m so sorry this sub gets a lot of requests for mattress recommendations, but I was hoping you guys could maybe help.

Please excuse me as I don’t know a ton about mattresses aside from my preference for feel and comfort- as well as how much I’m attracted to the marketing and design that some of the companies use (Casper).

I do realize that the best way to find a mattress for me would be to physically go to stores and test them out, but I’m not sure how well I can do that at this time. I’m hoping to maybe find a mattress available to be purchased online, that suits my hopes for a mattress.

First, I’d like to make sure that my mattress does not contain any fiberglass (or glass fiber)- be it within the mattress itself or within the flame-resistant covers/sock.

Budget isn’t an issue, as I would love a good quality mattress made of trusted materials so I was thinking ~$1,000-$1,500. I am young but have upper back and shoulder pain, so if anything could help out with that, that would be a bonus. I also generally love soft plush mattresses, and I don’t have a preference on how much heat is retained within the mattress.

I also don’t have a preference on memory-foam, or latex, etc. Just whatever is recommended by you guys, is appreciated greatly (:

I was thinking of maybe getting the Avocado Green or the Tuft and Needle Mint- but I wanted to make sure that no fiberglass is used within any of these- and also wanted to make sure others had a good experience with them.

Thank you so much in advance for your suggestions, I appreciate your time!"
"Is there such a thing as a bed bug mattress protector that is breathable / cool?. Seems like all of them just trap heat. 

Any suggestions?"
"Anyone tried this mattress? ""Signature Design by Ashley - 10 Inch Chime Express Memory Foam Mattress - Bed in a Box - Twin - White"" Would you recommend it?. I have really bad lower back pain, and I'm a college student so I can't afford an expensive mattress. I'm torn apart between this [Ashley mattress](https://www.amazon.com/Ashley-Furniture-Signature-Design-Mattress/dp/B0777K9RGX/ref=sr_1_26?dchild=1&keywords=medium%2Bfirm%2Bmattress%2Btwin&qid=1591049898&refinements=p_72%3A2661618011&rnid=2661617011&sr=8-26&th=1) and [Tuft and Needle's original mattress](https://www.tuftandneedle.com/mattress/original/).

"How long to let a 2” memory foam topper expand?. All I can find online is that you should wait 24-48 hours for a full on mattress to expand, but mine is just a topper and is only 2” thick. Do I really have to wait for 24 hours?"
"Experiences with Yaasa brand?. I’m looking to buy an adjustable non split king size bed and I came across Yassa during my search, but there is not much info out there. Anybody have any insights on this brand? Or recommendations?"
"Winkbeds Plus after 3 days. Set up my Windbed Plus queen size on Friday. Night one still had some sore back issues but I think I was just adjusting to the new mattress. My old one was over 20 years old was deformed. After 3 nights 90% of of my lower back  and shoulder soreness is gone. 

I have it set up on a new Ghostbed adjustable frame and new Layla Kapok pillows. 

I will update as the weeks go on. Any questions let me know."
"Anyone returned to a mattress store now that they have reopened?. Has anyone been recently (i.e. since stay at home has subsided)? Is it a comfortable experience? Anyone's thoughts and/or experiences would be helpful. 

I'm also hopeful there will be some sales coming up!! 

I'm in desperate need of a new mattress and prefer to compare several in person before buying (i.e. unwilling to buy online).  

Hoping I wouldn't be the first one on here to buy a mattress recently, but you never know!!"
"What Mattress to buy? I've already tried two with no luck.. I just moved into an apartment and I'm looking for a mattress. Unfortunately, I've tried two bed-in-a-box brands and both have left me with a lot of pain. I have a king bed frame so I'd be looking into getting a king mattress. I'd like to keep the price under the $1k mark if possible. 

For me, I'm a 5'8"" male, average build about 155 lbs. I'm a combination sleeper though and move between back, and stomach, and sometimes side. 

The first mattress I tried was a Tuft & Needle original, though it left me waking up with tons of low back pain. I traded that in for a BEAR original mattress, seemed to help a little bit with the low back pain, but I've noticed that my shoulders, neck  and upper back now ache a lot when I wake up...

Would anyone have any suggestions for alternative mattresses? I was looking at maybe an Oki Oki, Helix or a Layla Mattress. It’s a little hard to go into a store and try mattresses out now because of Covid. 

Thanks in advance!"
"Mattress Recommendation Request. I'm heading off to grad school this fall, and I'm facing the decision of buying my first mattress. I normally like making a very informed decision on expensive purchases such as this, and I find myself rather lost on this one. Also, since I am going to grad school, well, I am on a budget. 

&#x200B;

Here are the things that I am looking for (I think):

I am looking for a full mattress.

I've heard 10"" thickness is what I should be looking for.

I sleep hot and don't love memory foam, so I think I'm looking at spring mattresses.

Budget of around $300, but would be willing to go closer to $400 if it would make a significant difference.

&#x200B;

I would love any and all suggestions, and appreciate your input!"
"Are no-name mattresses okay to buy?. I went to a local store and they sold mattresses without a big name like Sealy, Serta, etc. The salesman said he had been in business for 3 years and the mattresses are made in a factory in North Carolina. Is this safe? Does anyone have experience with such mattresses or that kind of buying experience?"
"I need a good memory foam mattress for around $550 or less from Amazon. Hi! My boyfriend and I are moving into our first apartment together and we need a bed! 

I just want to go simple and order off of amazon and my only requirement is that it’s within our budget (I can sleep on literally anything) but my boyfriend does have a few preferences:

-wants something with springs 

-on the firmer side 

-king size

-stays cool

Also he’s concerned because he read something online that says memory foam mattress have some kind of chemical or whatever that can leak through them? Sounds like not a huge or very real thing to me but if anyone has some experience with this i’d love to know, thanks!"
"Avocado vs Winkbed vs Oliver Smith. I want to get a new mattress ASAP, I have a Serta memory foam topper but I’ve had it years and feel like I probably don’t have a great mattress. There’s the organic Oliver smith on amazon and it’s only like $300, compared to the others which are around $1,000. This is a huge price difference. 

I like the winkbed and dreamcloud. Also feel drawn to the Avocado. Is the winkbed really toxic free like the avocado? Any recommendations??"
What mattress do you have? What do you think of it?. 
"Any feedback on Helix Plus?. Looking for a medium firm, any thoughts?"
"So I ordered a Mattress, Now I need sheets, adjustable base, and PILLOWS!!!. I have tried to research but man with this stuff it seems like there are so many fake reviews and sites it's hard to get a real idea. I bought a king serta blue fusion so I assume the base will be two twins? As for pillows I tried out a rain 3.0 bedgear at a store and liked it but don't know how they hold up or if its worth the 170 dollars -_-

So far I have ordered Bedgear Hyper Cotton Sheets and 2 Storm 3.0 pillows."
"My Tempur-Pedic 30 Day Mattress Swap-out plus Accessories you should get!. We bought a Tempur-Pedic Pro-Breeze Medium about a month ago, and my wife felt that it was jut too firm, so I called Mattress Firm to swap out the mattress with the Tempur-Pedic Luxe Breeze Soft.  No problems at all on the swap-out, I just had to pay the price difference for the upgraded mattress.  They showed up the next day and removed the old mattress and setup the new one in the bedroom!

A few people commented on the crinkly Tempur-Pedic mattress protector.  You have the old one, they came out with a new one and it does not move around at all on the bed, has breathable siding, and looks like a pillow-top, with circular swirl designs on it.  The protector is very ""grippy"" on the underside, really keeping it in place on the bed.

I went with Bam Pure 100% Organic Bamboo sheets.  They seem to get nicer and softer every time I wash them, they are like breathable silk sheets.  They are super thin, and cool to the touch, giving me a super thin barrier between us and the bed.

The new Tempur-Pedic pillows come tomorrow, we bought them this weekend while all pillows were BOGO online.  Went with a king size Cloud Cooling Pro Pillow (Low), and the king size Tempur-Down Precise Support Pillow."
Opening new store.. It's been about 7 years since I have carried Serta. I am opening up a new location in the Phoenix area. Any store owners or sales people have feedback on their products. Looking at carrying entry level mattresses from $299 queen retail to $999 queen retail. Maybe even IComfort. Any thoughts would be helpful.
Looking for decent bed sheets that that are thickish and doesn't cost a lot.. Basically same as title. Looking for decent sheets that aren't to thin that feel good and cool while not being overly expensive. I know there are ones out there as  have bought random ones similar to what I want but don't know specific name or type.
"Mattress Sale Comparison; comparing quality with pricepoints?. Hey Everyone \~ This is my first post here. There are some mattresses on sale for this weekend. I'm coming from a 6"" foam...well foam on top of a couch for the past year so anything would be an improvement to that...I  hope.

Sorry for formatting, Any tips or things I can look out for. I saw some other posts but nothing that is super helpful except the 'main brands' aren't that great"
"Avocado or Luma. I'm taller and thinner, my girlfriend is avg height and thin. I mostly side sleep but occasionally roll on my stomach or back, she sleeps pretty much side and back. We run hot. Thinking of either the Avocado green mattress either with the topper or purchasing a latex topper somewhere else for it since it's expensive. Or thinking of the Luma Natural Latex Hybrid. She has lower back pain and sometimes my shoulders hurt sleeping on my side. Kinda of want medium/soft with support underneath. Any help, advice, or other recommendations would be great."
"Small body looking for opinions on possible soft mattress. Helix Sunset? Layla? Anything else?. As stated in the title, I'm a petite person around 120lb. I'm looking to purchase a size Full mattress for myself, as my 4 year old Ikea mattress was a rush buy and didn't work out for me in the long run. I thought it was just my bad sleeping habits and insomnia, but upon doing further research motivated by trying to find a better night's sleep with less body aches, I realized I should be sleeping on a 3 or 4 type of mattress and my current one probably sits at around a 7, far too firm as I now realize. Not even mattress toppers can make this rock sleep-apprropriate for me, I've tried. I didn't know anything about mattresses when I bought it though. Totally my bad. 

Now however, my hips, back, shoulders, shoulder blades, ribs and even ankles hurt from instinctively rolling over to sleep on my side. I'm petite and slim but curvy (aforementioned pressure points are awful), and I need something that sinks but has a bit of bounce as I don't want to feel like I'm being enveloped by quicksand when I'm moving.

I realize it might be too much to ask for a budget of, at most, $800USD, but it's what I can spend right now. I can't keep sleeping on this current one, my body won't handle it another month so I need a new mattress asap, but I don't plan on keeping the one I buy for more than a few years, just until I find something better later or find the budget for something more expensive, so longevity isn't a priority.

For obvious reasons (our modern day black plague) I won't be going to a mattress store to try anything out. I was looking for affordable box mattresses and stumbled upon two possibly decent options: the Layla memory foam mattress and the Helix Sunset (not to be confused with the Sunset Luxe). I've read up on the Layla mattress and the soft side seems to lean a bit firmer than I'd like, but I'd be willing to try it if anyone wants to contradict this assumption. I'm more interested in the Helix Sunset, but haven't found much discourse on it anywhere. Based on a YouTube video I found though, it seems to be exactly what I'm looking for, but I'd really love to hear from anyone who has it, and what your thoughts and feelings are regarding it. 

If you have any suggestions besides the ones I've mentioned, I'd love to hear what you have to say, but please don't try to convince me to buy something more expensive. You'll just make me cry because as much as I'd love to buy a $2,000 cloudlike mattress, money is very tight for me right now and I'm already pushing it with my current budget. Both the Layla and the Helix currently have discounts so they fall within my budget.

TLDR: petite person looking for soft mattress due to body aches from rush buying a too-firm mattress. Need help, info, and recommendations, but leaning toward Helix Sunset, so if anyone has one and wants to give me the lowdown on it, I'd super appreciate it.

Thanks for reading!"
Platform/box springs for Tufts and needle mattress. I just purchased a full size Nod Tufts and Needle mattress (exclusive to Amazon).

"Englander Mattress - Any good?. My parents who are older are looking at getting a new mattress and today a local shop offered to sell them a mattress called the Englander (this is the brand name).

Looking for a good foam mattress <500 (returnable only). I've been a spring mattress man my whole life. The girlfriend wants to try a foam mattress. I think we'll hate it but I want to give it an honest chance. Whats a good <$500 foam mattress I can get on Amazon?
"Durability of a Softer Latex Mattress... HELP!. I have tried configurations of Savvy Rest Serenity mattresses at a local shop. I am deciding between 2.   
Zone 1:  
Top: Soft Talalay

Middle: Soft Dunlop

Bottom: Medium Dunlop  


Zone 2:   
Top: Soft Talalay

Middle: Medium Dunlop

Bottom: Firm Dunlop

I am going to order from SleepEZ since they are having an absurd sale at the moment and the price is hard to pass up. Plus, SleepEZ allows returns and Savvy does not. Zone 1 works great for me and I am in perfect alignment. It is pretty soft however. I am a little concerned about the durability. I know latex is the cream of the crop for durability, but with any soft mattress, it is always a worry!

Can anyone provide some input on how Zone 1 would hold up over time? I'm a little less worried about Zone 2 but still..."
"New Mattress Adjustment Period. I got a new mattress that has adjustable latex comfort layers. Started out with a medium and struggled to sleep on it for more than a couple days in a row. When I would sleep on it, it was just very uncomfortable. So called for a replacement layer and in talks with them, they said to replace it with a soft layer.

Tried that but couldn’t even make it through one night cause the lower back pain & then numbness started to radiate to my arms. Realize now that maybe the medium just wasn’t stiff enough. But also I know I haven’t given this mattress much a shot but when I’m in physical pain just laying on it compared to my over a decade old furniture foam grade mattress. It just seems like something is wrong.

I say all that to basically ask, what is the difference between bad fit & just adjusting to new mattresses? Cause I’m just tired and frustrated and even when I got the mattress, it just wasn’t comfortable to lay down in just casually."
"Which pillowtop mattress of Sealy or Simmons is closest to a Westin Heavenly bed mattress?. Hi all,

I see a lot of mattress sales ending this week.  I've read some of the details about coils.  Is there a under $1K mattress which has the support but soft pillowtop for side sleepers?  But not memory foam, because for some reason the delay in the sinking drives me crazy.  

I understand that mattress pads and linens make a difference too, but I'm just wondering if any Costco (etc.) mattress has the coils with a soft enough top?  Every time I go to buy a new mattress, I can't stand all the variables and quit."
"Leggett & Platt vs Ergomotion Bed Frames. My wife and I are shopping for a new bed, upgrading from queen to king now that we have room.

I want an adjustable base, preferably with all the bells and whistles, and I know there are a ton out there. From some preliminary research I've heard good things about both Leggett & Platt and Ergomotion, but not any specifics on why. Does anyone have experience with warranty claims with either, or recommendations either way? I am willing to spend the money to get a good one but I know they aren't returnable and I've seen some horror stories with frames breaking and not having warranty support. I'd appreciate any advice people have."
"Tempur-Pedic Cloud BIAB (Long review). What’s up, everyone!

Before I purchased the Tempur-Pedic Cloud BIAB (Queen, Medium), I was unable to find too many reviews. This made it difficult for me to pull the trigger, but there were a few reasons why I took the chance anyway. After listing these reasons, I’ll begin my review portion upon receiving the mattress.

1) Brand. I’ll be honest, I always wanted a Tempur-Pedic. The name is synonymous in the mattress industry with lush comfort. It was the factor that immediately drew me in. I wanted to see what the fuss was about and I was tired of using spring mattresses.

2) I desperately needed a new mattress. There’s no other way to say it. Living in NYC, everywhere has been closed for months. I know that this is the case almost everywhere, but maybe a little bit more here. So no mattress stores open, no trying anything out, no bargaining with sleazy salesmen.

3) Easy shipping. #2 directly ties into this. The mattress came very quickly and efficiently, SUPER vacuum sealed and rolled around what seemed to be an infinite amount of times. It’s truly mind-blowing to see the before and after of the bed in the bag and now on my base. 

4) Price. Yes, **price**. It’s crazy to think about a value from Tempur-Pedic, but as someone trying a Tempur for the 1st time and always having hand-me-downs from family members and/or cheap mattresses, I thought this was a steal. I purchased it directly from Tempur’s website and it was $1,523.50 after tax, free shipping. DON’T BUY THE MATTRESS AT THE FULL $1,999. I’m noticing that it’s **always** on sale for 30% off to get it to the price I paid. Literally every week or every other week. It’s even that discounted price right now. It’s to the point that I don’t even consider it a steal. Instead, I just feel like they catch a few people willing to pay the higher price in the interim of “sales.” The mattress is $1,399 (Queen) retail and Tempur knows it.

OK. So those were my direct reasons for purchasing it at the time. Now I’m going to begin the review portion. Keep in mind, this is probably my 1st in depth review for anything so it’s not going to be great.

**Receiving the mattress**

As I said earlier, UPS delivered the mattress quickly. They did lie and say that they tried to deliver it last Thursday, but that no one was home. I don’t want to get into a rant, but that was a lie. I was home all day as I have been and they didn’t knock, ring my doorbell, or leave the slip that they’re supposed to. Therefore, the mattress had to come Tuesday because it was MD weekend. However, if it would’ve come Thursday like it should’ve, that would’ve been only a few days after my order so I’m going to chalk that up to a screwup by UPS and that normally Tempur ships quickly.

**Setting it up**

This part wasn’t too bad, but definitely was not as easy as Tempur and fake reviewers made it seem. It’s 100% a 2 person job. For starters the mattress is very heavy. I don’t have exact specs, but I believe with all of the plastic covering and in the bag, it’s about 90lb. That may not seem that heavy, but here’s the thing:

It’s not as simple as rolling it out on the bed once. You need to roll it and roll it and roll it in order to get all of the Saran Wrap and then thicker plastic covering off. My wife and I must have kept rolling it around about 15-20 times. So the once not *so* heavy 90lb became a little bit of a struggle, but not the worst.

**Trying the mattress**

Before I get to this part, I want to say that the mattress RAPIDLY expanded very very quickly. We had a huge, queen sized mattress in seconds. My wife and I laughed about originally wanting to do a time lapse. We were told to give it a lot of time to set before laying on it.  I’ve heard 30 min, 1 hour, 3 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, and 48 hours... so since everyone was making up their own numbers and my wife and I were terribly exhausted from setting up our extensive bed frame all day, we gave it about 5 minutes and then laid down.

The mattress was very firm, but also a bit soft. Firm in the sense that we didn’t sink in too much, but soft in the sense that it wasn’t firm like a rock or a brick. I’d say I’m *satisfied* so far, but my wife absolutely LOVES it.

**Disclaimers**

I wanted to put this at the top of the review, but there were things that I wanted to immediately say about the mattress because of the flow of this review so therefore, I decided to put it here:

1) Lets get this out of the way ASAP. I’ve never used this sub before trying to find a mattress to buy and honestly, I’m not sure how active I’ll be now that I have one, but I’ll probably dabble here and there just to offer whatever help and/or advice that I can. Having said that, I’m in no way a worker for Tempur or a paid reviewer of any kind lol you can see by my reddit account that I’m just a social studies teacher.

2) In my extensive research of prior posts in this sub, I’ve seen many people bashing mattress reviews. I 100% agree and understand that everyone is different, both physically and in economic capabilities. What’s comfortable for me may not be comfortable for someone else. What’s firm/soft for me may not be firm or soft for someone else. Tempur’s are expensive. What’s expensive for someone may be cheap for someone else and vice versa. Based on my few weeks in this sub, it seems that most people are looking for a temporary mattress for under $1k whether it be until they can afford something more expensive, for a guest room, for college, or whatever else. I understand. HAVING SAID THAT, I do think that mattress reviews could be very helpful. They don’t have to just include the subjective opinions. Price is objective. Customer service is objective (sort of), which by the way, Tempur has seemed to be very honest and helpful thus far. So it’s just my opinion that I would love to see more reviews in this sub, but that’s just me.

3) IT’S ONLY BEEN 1 DAY. Yes, I agree. I’ve only had the mattress for 1 night of sleeping. I’ll absolutely come back and do an update on this post or in the comments, but I really have a good feeling about the mattress. I was worried about the 10’’ not being enough for my wife and I who are a lot heavier than average.

**Miscellaneous**

I didn’t intend for this post to be so long so I’ll just throw these facts in instead of making whole paragraphs for each:

1) My wife and I are both side and back sleepers. Usually start on our sides and then turn to our backs overnight. 

2) The mattress was a bit warm last night. Definitely closer to hot than cold, but it’s extremely muggy/humid in NYC right now so I have to take that into consideration."
"This Sub Has Me More Confused Than Ever? Reasonable Alternative to Casper. Currently moving and looking to buy a new Queen mattress. Unfortunately, due to COVID, majority of mattress stores in my area are basically closed or very limited (Canada). Last time I bought a mattress, I walked around a showroom, lying on my side on a ton of mattresses and ended up buying some Kingsdown Pillowtop that was on sale for $800. It was horrible after a few weeks, it somehow become just too firm and I had to throw a memory foam thing on top to make to sleep-able.

I saw all the marketing and paid promotions on online mattresses (namely Casper and Endy), and didn't expect them to change my life, but after narrowing it down, $1000 for a Casper Hybrid seems reasonable enough for side sleepers. Then I read on this sub absolute vitriol for these brands, but I don't understand solid alternatives that doesn't require tremendous effort or paying more than $1500. 

I don't want to make my own bed or have a latex mattress custom made for me. I am moving in two weeks and just want a reasonable online shopping experience and delivery. Every time I shop at SleepCountry or other mattress stores online, I can't find any actual information or reviews about specific mattresses online as it seems mattress companies make sure that every store has differently named mattresses.

How do you guys shop for mattresses? And am I completely unreasonable in wanting to buy the Casper Hybrid as there is so much information about it online I know what to expect?"
"Horrible slats. We bought a 180 x 200 cm Ottoman bed. We bought a latex mattress to fit the bed, unfortunately the wooden slats keep bending under our weight and as a consequence our mattress has been ruined, both my side and my wife's side have very big dips on them. Does anyone have experience with this happening and any solution. we tried buying another mattress but unfortunately the same happened. We are considering buying slat frames and placing it on top of the current slats, would this help? thank You"
"Can someone give me a recommendation? I’m looking to spend no more than $1200 on a queen sized bed + bed frame.. Hello r/mattress! I’ve been looking around at options, and I have no idea what to get. 

I’m primarily a back-sleeper, and prefer a medium-to-firm bed that won’t wilt in the middle. 

The bed frame doesn’t have to be high quality unless you think it would benefit me.

I’m also open to getting a full-sized bed since it’ll fit my small room better. 

What do you recommend?"
"Cool/heavy comforter recommendations?. Hi all,
I recently purchased a king sized bed and it'll be arriving in a few weeks so I have to prepare before then. Luckily,  I already found cheap cool bamboo sheets I know I love but my luck with comforters is not so great. All of the comforters I've ever bought seem to run ridiculously hot. However, I do like the feeling of having weight on me.

Does anyone have any recommendations for cool comforters? If they're heavy as well, that would be a massive bonus but I realize that my request might be a little unrealistic. Thanks in advance!"
"1inch or 2inch soft latex topper?. I just got a sleeponlatex medium queen. After one week I am still waking up with a sore back. My old mattress was pretty bad. It was uneven and had sickages but I didnt wake up with a sore back as often. 

This new mattress feels very comfortable if i am in bed reading or just relaxing. But it feels like the latex is pushing back a bit too much when I go to sleep(I guess another way of saying it is a bit too firm feeling). The company has offered me 50% off a 1inch or 2inch soft latex topper. Would a 1inch topper make enough of a difference or should I go with 2 inches? Will the 2 inch compromise too much support?"
"Chronic back pain- firmness of PURPLE 2 or Casper ? *need before next surgery. I need a new mattress- i have multiple tumors in my lower back which impede nerve tissue

"i have a 160cm bed base; wondering if a 180 bed topper on top would not ruin the experience?. Hi all, this is my first post in the subreddit; would like to get some advice on my plans in upgrading my bed setup:

* i have an ikea bed base + old mattress = 160cm
* i plan to replace it with a new non-ikea 160x200x24 Pocketed Springs, Memory Foam mattress and keep the bed frame.
* and add a memory foam mattress topper **180x200x4** on top (they don't have a 160cm ver available)

"New mattress need a foundation or frame. I'm thinking of buying a Titan mattress. Bigger guy here, 6'4 about 300 pounds. I'm trying to drop weight, but I need a new mattress and the titan seems nice. My question is, their foundation is sold out and I'm a bit apprehensive to buy their frame because people say it squeaks. 

I'll be up front, I've never bought a mattress before, so which would be best? A frame or a foundation? and are all foundations the same? For instance, the one sold by Titan (Brooklyn Bedding) is an Ascension Bi-fold foundation and at the moment the full sized one is sold out. The same foundation is sold by a few other mattress sellers. So is it the exact same one? Which would you guys recommend for someone my size/girth?

"Is my mattress killing my back? Waking up with increasingly bad back pain.. Hey guys, 

For about a year or so, I'll wake up with a stiff back, but it's hitting a point of saturation. Bending over to pick up my dog's poop on morning walks is something I have to brace myself for and I gotta do something about this. 

I'm 32, 185lbs at 6'2"", very athletic-looking (I say ""looking"" because I don't exercise enough, though I'm working on that, adding yoga/flexibility stuff in) Point is, I'm not overweight or advancing in years, I am flexible enough to touch my toes, never had a back injury. 

The mattress in question is a Brooklyn Bedding Arctic Dreams 10"". It's very, very soft, which I don't necessarily love or hate -- just trying to find the best solution to this problem. I'm definitely not a person who hates firm mattresses, though.

 I generally sleep on my side and wind up on my stomach or angled a combination of the two. The mattress is getting up there in years -- maybe 6 or 7? 

I'm trying to find a solution that'll get me out of this ""waking up in pain"" thing. Owing to the COVID situation, I'm not working, so I don't have a ton of money to throw at this issue. I realize cheaper mattresses generally have a pretty short shelf-life, but while I'm very bummed about the prospect of excess waste in the world, I am not ruling out getting a significantly cheaper mattress I can replace in a year or two -- just trying to get to the point of a morning where I wake up without a super-stiff back. 

Is there a mattress in the sub-$500 range that can cure what ails me? Obviously I'd RATHER drop $1200+ on one, but circumstances are conspiring against that at the moment. Any suggestions/recommendations greatly appreciated."

"platform for latex mattress. Hi all. I am looking at getting a king size latex mattress from sleep on latex but was reading that they recommend a solid base or slats 3 inches or closer (the closer the better). I cant afford to spend a ton a base and it looks like solid ones are pretty hard to come by and that most slatted are 3 inches. I understand also that airflow to the bottom is important to prevent moisture buildup. My question is, is there any reason I couldn't just add plywood with holes drilled into it on top of the slats or even cardboard? It seems like the slats would still be the thing supporting the weight and that really what is just needed is something to fill the gaps while providing air circulation? Thoughts or experience? Thanks!"

"T&N help needed. So out of 11 mattresses we tried the first I wasn't allergic to with a rash was the T&N hybrid. The company told me this was the softest at a 4 on the firmness scale and their Mint was a 5. After recieving both beds the Mint is a bit too soft and the Hybrid is a ROCK. I had bruises from leaning on my elbows.

Anyone had either the T&N Hybrid or the Mint past the warranty or a couple of years and can advise me what I'm in for? Both had great reviews and I am so confused. Also I wanted to try them side by side and now can only return one.



Also we opened the Mint cover after it made us sick inside as its still heavily offgassing after 2 weeks outside and I broke out in a rash from touching the fire sock. Can I be alergic to the fire sock in all the beds? Not alergic to the hybrid after offgassing outside."
"I just moved and now my mattress is lumpy (hybrid mattress). I have a Beauty Rest Black Hybrid Gladney in king size that I bought about a year ago. 

It’s been great but I just moved to another city and now it’s all lumpy.

This mattress weighs a fuck ton and doesn’t keep its shape well, so the movers had a hell of a time getting it down the stairs in the first place and then up the stairs in the next place. They did the entire move in one day so it didn’t sit in a certain spot for too long, I don’t think.

What can I do? This is the second night and it maybe feels a bit better or I’m just getting used to it. It feels like the layers just got bunched up in random spots from being hauled around."
"Two nights on Nolah 12"" Flippable King Mattress and I hate it. Does it ever get soft? What do I do?. My husband and I like a very, very soft mattress. We've been sleeping on a hand-me-down traditional spring queen mattress plus two 1.5"" foam toppers from Costco. It's worked fine for us for five years (replacing the toppers every Christmas) but it did sleep hot. We recently bought our first house and decided to upgrade to a king mattress so our dog (105 lb GSD mix) can sleep with us.

I'm 5'9"" 125 lbs and a side sleeper. My husband is 6'2"" 180 lbs and a side/back sleeper. We agreed that we liked foam mattresses and wanted to get the softest one possible. I like the feeling of sinking into a mattress and I want to feel absolutely no pressure. The doggo has a hip problem and has trouble jumping, so we got a platform bed that's very low to the ground to accommodate him.

After a month of research (independent reviewer sites, aggregate sites, Google Reviews, and posts here) we narrowed it down to either Bear Pro or Nolah 12"". A Sleepopolis review on the softest mattresses on the market convinced me that Nolah was the one. We ordered last week, it arrived on Tuesday, we set it up Wednesday, and have slept on it for two nights.

It's UNBELIEVABLY firm. I don't sink into it at all! It legitimately feels like I'm sleeping on the hardwood floor. The first night, we tossed and turned and agreed that we were probably sleeping on the ""firm"" side of the flippable mattress. I woke up with bruises on my hip and shoulder and horrible pain in my back. My husband didn't sleep at all! The whole bed seemed to be pressure points.

I contacted customer support to get instructions for flipping the mattress and they informed me that we were, in fact, sleeping on the ""soft"" side. They said it took a few days for the mattress to adjust and actually get soft. With much trepidation, we slept on it for one more night (last night) with identical results. This is *not* a soft mattress. 

What do I do? Last night I ended up sleeping on top of a memory foam pillow to give my aching shoulders some relief. Should I keep doing that for two more weeks and hope that the mattress finally begins to live up to the marketing claims? Does Nolah sell a topper that would actually make this thing tolerable?

According to the website, Nolah only accepts returns after you've slept on the mattress for 30 nights. Then we can begin the returns process until the 120-night trial period is up. That seems like an extreme amount of time to sleep on an uncomfortable mattress."
"Tempur-pedic “donation” king mattress quality / fair price?. An acquaintance is selling an unused Tempur-pedic king mattress that says “Donation - not for resale” on it. He is in the military and hasn’t taken it out of the plastic.

"Do side sleepers prefer soft or firm? Having my usual worries after our purchase today.. https://www.bowlesmattress.com/Products/Mattresses--By-Series/Gold-Series/207/Malibu

We decided on a mattress today.  We have done weeks of research and we had pretty well decided on Bowles mattresses due to their quality materials they use. We have been to 4 different stores, and tried probably 20 different mattresses BEFORE trying Bowles (knowing that these would probably be top of the line for us). Turns out.. they were. You can feel the quality.  

We spent probably 2-3 hours at the Bowles store and decided on this Malibu. We felt that our spines were perfectly aligned, our shoulders and hips were able to sink in, yet we felt supported in our mid section. We liked the more “sinking-in” feeling. Rather than the “Sleeping on top” feeling.

After purchasing it, we started having worries that it won’t be supportive enough. We always thought we preferred a firmer mattress, but we ended up liking one of the softest mattresses they make. According to their scale anyways. And we’re on the heavy side, I’m 230 lbs and she’s about 180. 

What do other side sleepers prefer? Should we worry that it won’t be supportive enough?"
"Buying a mattress, need help picking which one.. Hey all!

Needed some assistance when it comes to picking out my first mattress. I'm a pretty heaving side sleeper but switch a few times during the night to my back and other side.

As of now, ideally, i'd like to keep the budget to anything lower than 1,100ish for a queen. (This will be for me and my girlfriend)

My options i've looked at have been the nectar, purple, tuft and needle, and casper mattress. However, i've only seen those because they're quite heavily commercialized and are on a good budget. Also from experience, i'd probably prefer something on a medium scale of firmness (probably around a 5-7) and id say im your average sleeper than isn't too heavy nor too light of a sleeper.

Any recommendations on what I should get?

"Looking for firm queen mattress recs, 1-2k budget. My partner and I are currently shopping for a queen sized mattress and are kind of overwhelmed with all the info out there! Would love some recs. We’re 5’5 115lb and 6’1 140lb

We want a pretty firm mattress (probably with coils). We’ve been sleeping on a shikibuton—which is kind of like a <2in thick quilt—for the past year with no problems. We’re moving to a bigger place though so we’d like to switch to a mattress.

Our budget is flexible, ideally it would be around 1k but if we’re missing out on something phenomenal we could do 2k. It’s mostly sticker shock imo. We’ve been looking at the Purple 3 for but it’s unclear if the price is worth it..? Also is it just me or are all the reviews weirdly positive?

This may be the definitive mattress info source. I’ve been reading through The Mattress Underground themattressunderground.com website and it is really informative!

What I find really fascinating is this whole subset of mattress companies that are “do it yourself”...we are going that route.
"Tempurpedic Pro Adapt Medium Hybrid King Sale?. First timer buying a new bed.

"Lurked here for a few months...Finally bought a Verlo!. My partner has been complaining about my 14 year old Queen sizes Original Mattress Factory mattress for about a year. I was still mostly comfortable, but in the last few months I started waking up in pain. We also adopted a second dog that loves to sleep in (and hog) the bed... So we decided to use our stimulus money to move up to a king size. I’m a “researcher” and research the shit out of stuff before making a purchase (especially a large one).So, after lurking here and on The Mattress Underground for a few months, we decided to visit our local Verlo store in Atlanta. I had my eye on the V9 and V11 lines. We were pretty well taken care of. The owner answered the few questions I had and we tried out the different models in the V9 line. Unfortunately, they didn’t have the V11 on display... but I was ok with that. Was a bit more than I wanted to spend anyways. They had a cutaway of the mattress sitting on top of every mattress, which was great for quickly identifying what the differences in comfort layers were between the models. We ended up liking the V9 pillow top the best. I prefer a softer mattress and my partner wants a lot of support and usually gets a firmer mattress (his old mattress in the guest room feels like sleeping on a concrete slab to me LOL) He was pleasantly surprised with how supportive the V9 pillow top was, while still being plenty soft enough for me. The transaction was super easy. No haggling... the price is the price, which was super great to me. I hate haggling and wondering after if I got the “best” price. 

The mattress was delivered yesterday. This morning we both woke up after an awesome nights sleep. I expected a week or two of some aches while we got used to the new sleeping surface, but hot damn it was comfortable. We both agree that it was one of the most comfortable nights sleep we’ve ever had. The motion isolation of the pocket coils alone is worth it. My partners and the dog both toss and turn at night, which would shake the whole OMF inner spring unit we had. I couldn’t feel a thing with the V9 pillow top when they moved around. All in all, it’s been a great experience so far. Will update after a month or two if there is any interest. I just wanted to share my experience since there wasn’t much about Verlo here while I was doing research. It seems to be an incredibly well made product and I hope it lasts for a long time. The company is very open about construction and foam densities. I really think it will probably outlast the OMF bed, which lasted me quite a long time. Happy to answer any questions if you got em!"
"Purple 3 making “sticky” noise all of a sudden.. I received my Purple 3 mattress early last week and it’s been great up until last night. All of a sudden the purple grid on the mattress started making this “sticky” noise. It sounds like the hyper elastic polymer is sticking to itself every  time I change positions.

"Suggestions? Non memory foam!. I’ve been sleeping on an S bed for 13 years and I hate it.

"Split king with different thickness mattresses. Hi Guys,

I’m getting a 14” Beautyrest Black “Scarlett” delivered on Tuesday in a split king format (2 twin xl’s) but my awesome salesman just found me a single twin xl Tempur-Pedic luxe breeze soft on outlet (preowned) for a great price which was the mattress I really wanted but was too expensive.

My concern here is the Tempur mattress is only 12.75” thick so there will be more than a 1” depth gap where the beds push up against each other.

I’m worried this will be awkward for trying to cuddle with my wife, rolling over in the middle of the night, and for being intimate.

Anyone have thoughts on this, is it worth the gamble to get the Tempur-Pedic?

I’d have no return and no warranty on the Tempur also but a full manufacturer warranty and 30 days return period in the Beautyrest."

"Purple mattress still not here- ordered may 17. I ordered a purple mattress on May 17 and since that time every time i've checked my order status it still says ""order is being processed"". Last week I called customer service and they said the mattress is set to deliver on June 2 through UPS however nothing came to my house today and my status still says ""order is being processed""

... um what

so either the website tracking is off or customer service had misinformation? either way i'm getting a \~little\~ worried about my mattress. Can anyone tell me if they've had similar experiences and if this is a normal wait time, especially during covid?"
"Have both lower back and neck/shoulder issues, looking for recommendations/advice as I make first mattress purchase. Hey all, just wanted to start by saying I've been scanning the forum and have read the FAQ, which has resolved a lot of questions and also spurred new ones!

**Current mattress:** I'm 30 years old and I've been sleeping on the same mattress for 15-20 years. It's just a standard old Serta coiled mattress, although I couldn't tell you much more about it. 

**Back/neck issues:** I've got some minor scoliosis in my lower back and my neck is fairly prone to locking up after a night of sleeping in the wrong position. I'd describe my condition as moderate pain but fairly chronic depending on my activity level/sleeping.

The mattress I have now is fairly firm, which I used to really like but my wife hated so we bought a 3 inch thick Lucid memory foam topper from Amazon (which I now realize was probably a mistake).  It definitely made the bed softer, but it almost felt like I had to fight to crawl out of my cradle every time I wanted to turn over in bed. Doing this during my sleep really aggravated my neck/shoulders, so we ditched the topper and now the bed is so firm I hate sleeping on it,so it's time for a change.

**My weight:** My weight ranges anywhere from 145-150 lbs and my wife is about 105 lbs. 

**Desired softness:** I think what I'm looking for is a mattress that's of medium softness--something with a little comfort but also plenty of support for my back issues. She's a light sleeper and I'm a fairly heavy sleeper so I'm also looking for something that will minimize my moving around or getting in and out of bed from impacting her.

**Foam?:** I'm not averse to memory foam, but the topper we used kind of turned me off to it because 1.) I'm a hot sleeper and 2.) I always felt like I was crawling out of a pit every time I needed to shift. I like sleeping on a thicker pillow I can use to cradle my head and support my neck, but my thick pillow became WAY too thick given how much I sank into the topper.  Should I give foam another chance, and was it just the quality/thickness of the topper I bought? 

**Price range:** Also wanting to get some price opinions from the people here. How much is too little to pay for a mattress (we're looking at getting a king), and how much is way too much? I can surmise that tempur-pedic is the top of the line for foam mattresses, but are there other brands that provide a similar durability and quality for less money? I don't want to pay a premium for a specific name if I don't have to, but I also still want to have a comfortable, quality mattress that will last. I'm thinking our price range is $1,000-$1,500, but I'm open to everyone here telling me that's way too little or too much.

I don't trust that I'll be able to make a great decision based solely on trying something out in a store because I know the bed will change over time and the number of hours slept in a bed will have a different effect on my back/neck than a store tryout will.  I'm also fairly skeptical of going into a mattress store because COVID-19 has really started to intensify in my area. If I do go, it will probably be to narrow down from a list of options I already have in my head.

**Tl;dr**: I have scoliosis and mild but chronic neck pain. I weigh 150, wife weighs 105. Probably looking for a medium softness that gives me support but that I don't have to struggle to move around in. I'm not sure what type of quality to expect from any given price range so any advice will be welcomed and heeded, including any horror stories or good stories you have to share!"
"I recently bought a new memory foam mattress and a waterproof mattress encasement. Will using the mattress encasement prevent the new mattress odor from fading away?. Moved into a new place and completely bought new bedding, a new bed frame, comforter, pillows, pillowcases, and bedsheets. I'm generally aware a mix of all these things are gonna produce an odor typically produced by things opened right out of the box. I feel like the mattress cover, comforter, and pillows will naturally fade away as they are put in the open and as they get cleaned. But what about the mattress? I opened up the mattress and let it sit for about 24 hours before covering it up and using it. Since the mattress is covered up, will the smell coming from it keep lingering? Should I take off the encasement until the smell goes away?"
"Bonell Spring or Pocket spring. Hey everyone. I'm in search of a spring mattress. I went to a shop today, and I found Bonell spring mattress with pillow top to be more comfortable. I haven't tried Pocket spring. I'm 22 male, and Im looking for a soft mattress. What would you recommend? The salesman told me that pocket spring is more reliable and comfortable. However it does not have pillow top. What do you suggest?

Bonell spring is available in 10.5 inches whereas pocket spring is available in 12 inches."
"Looking for recommendation - 190lbs, side sleeper, terrible back pain. Hello - i currently have a super soft mattress with terrible edge support and i exclusively sleep on my side. I'm very weary of all of the online mattress stores and reviews which all seem paid. How come none of the review sites mention sealy serta temper etc? What kind of bed would be recommended? A hybrid? Firm/Soft/Medium?  
  
Thanks in advance!"
"Mattress recommendations for two side sleepers. Hello! I'm looking for a mattress that would be good for my husband and I. We're both side sleepers and currently experience back/hip/shoulder pain from a mattress that is both sagging in the center and too firm. 

Does anyone have a good recommendation?"
"Can I still use my box spring with my new raised bed frame?. I have a king size memory foam mattress, and up until now I have had it on the box spring on the floor with no issues. I recently purchased this metal bed frame [here](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Foldable-Platform-Tool-Free-Under-Bed/dp/B07R7XFD22/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=king+bed+frame+no+box+spring+needed&qid=1591133842&sr=8-8). I am moving into a much smaller space and I will need the storage underneath. It seems to have good reviews, and a friend has the same frame and loves it.

So... can I still use my box spring? I purchased an extra long bed skirt etc so it hopefully will cover the space nicely. Every post and review seems to be people praising the fact that they no longer need the box spring. I kind of like the idea of a higher, platform sleeping situation. I don't want to risk anything sliding around, however, or some kind of weight collapse (for reference i weigh about 150 so hopefully that wouldn't be an issue). I also kind of feel like this frame with the metal bars might gradually deteriorate the memory foam if I put the mattress directly on it. 

Does anyone have a box spring on a metal platform frame? Or can anyone advise on what I ought to do or give me some peace of mind that this isn't a completely insane idea?

Thanks!"
"Athlete’s Choice Gold, Aspen 3.0. Long story short, wife and I checked out mattresses at Denver mattress and liked both of these mattresses a lot. We are both side sleepers and they both felt soft enough for that. I move a lot as I normally sleep pretty poorly and it often wakes her up on the current mattress, but she couldn’t feel me moving on these. They are both well priced. Has anyone owned these mattresses before, and if so, would you recommend them? Thanks!"
"Anyone purchased mattress/bedframe from Nectar recently?. My mom bought a mattress and adjustable bed frame at Nectar last April 15. Mattress came in 3 weeks after but the bed frame is still nowhere to be found until now. Their customer service rep has reached out a month ago notifying us that some items will be delayed due to the pandemic. Upon checking FedEx tracking, it appears that the shipping is still 'pending'. We tried reaching out to Nectar's customer service via email and phone number but they have not been responding... 

Anyone has/had similar experiences? Any suggestion on what to do next? Thank you!"
"Mattress Shopping: a Step Below Car Shopping. After much lurking I've researched countless brands and just came upon lucid. Is this too good to be true?   \~$500 for a latex hybrid? Anyone have any experience with Lucid they'd care to share?  


Current bed is a Beauty rest pillow top, ""Lagoon Mist Plush"" was really comfortable but dips majorly on my side to where the ""good"" side still has an angle to it. Was a cheap but very comfortable mattress for the 2-3ish years it has lasted me. Fell in love with the Intellibed Midnight at a Mattress Firm but its waaaaay out of my price range for right now. Looking for 500-1000 USD until next time when I upgrade to a king and can drop several thousand.   


I'm honestly lost. Last time I bought a bed it was so comfortable but the comfort only lasted like a year or two. I'v read the Mattress FAQ but it complicates things even more now and Im not sure how to get the most bang for my buck.   


Any guidance?"
"What I did accidentally might be the best way forward.. So a year ago on memorial day I bought my first mattress ever. All the ones I used in my college years were either given to me or provided by the University. my future was not certain at that point so I did not want to buy something expensive and then not be able to move it later on so I ended up buying a Queen spring mattress for about a hundred and fifty from mattress firm. 

It was fine at first but after about a month sleeping on it I was tired of how firm it was and decided to get a $75 memory foam mattress topper from Amazon. I think that this resulted in the firm but soft feel that people like. For under 300 I cannot complain. Now I bought my first house and I have a guest room and I need another mattress.

I thought I was going to get his zinus $250 memory foam mattress then I found out about the fiberglass
I thought I was going to get a tuft and needle to avoid the fiberglass but then I found out that they're hard as a rock and wear out after a few years.

Now I realize that maybe the make your own bed approach is great. With the topper on top the spring mattress underneath will wear out very slowly and in a few years time when the mattress topper inevitably wears out I can just buy another one very cheaply compared to replacing a new bed.

I think I need to get some duct tape in tape the corners down  to the mattress and DEEP POCKET SHEETS ARE A MUST.

What are y'all's thoughts on this?


TLDR: with all of the shity cheap mattresses being dangerous or not durable it makes better sense to me too make your own using a cheap spring mattress and a mattress topper."
"Y’all, talk me off the “first night on a new mattress” ledge.... Ok, y’all. I did a ton of trial time and research and ended up with a memory foam mattress. It came yesterday, and it was supportive...like a wall. I have back and neck issues and woke up sore. 

I get that mattresses have a break in period; I plan to have the kids put on socks and walk on it today. My husband also said that our Tempur-Pedic was like that at the beginning (I was pregnant and vomiting, so I don’t remember). 

I have a 60 day trial period. I didn’t buy from a chain. I just need someone to tell me it’s going to get better. ???? The only other mattress we both liked was a Stearns and Foster hybrid, and it was about 1k more and I was afraid it would have the same issues as our old hybrid."
"Attaching the mattress to an adjustable bed frame. Any ideas to secure a hybrid mattress to an adjustable bed frame?

It lifts without my weight on it and slightly with me on it. Seems to be mostly in the middle when in TV watching mode.

I was thinking of velcro tape to the bottom of the mattress and to the frame. 

I ordered 4 inch hook and loop tape self-adhesive strips set with sticky glue nylon fabric, fastener black 3 yards 

Pros? Cons? Just live with it?"
"NordicTrack Sleep Mattress?. I was looking to build a mattress(posted here earlier today) but just came across this.. [https://www.costco.com/nordictrack-sleep-13%22-hybrid-mattress.product.100659652.html](https://www.costco.com/nordictrack-sleep-13%22-hybrid-mattress.product.100659652.html)

&#x200B;

It is a bit less($75 or so) than building one, but no latex. Then again, I could easily get a 2"" latex topper for it and be at around the DIY price.

What do you guys think? I talked to Costco and they said if I am not absolutely satisfied within the next year(if I buy) then they will send a freight truck to come pick it up and give me a complete full refund, so that's good piece of mind."
"TempurPedic ProAdapt soft vs Medium Hybrid?. I am in the market for a new mattress to replace my old Sleep Innovations 10-Inch SureTemp Memory Foam Mattress that I got from Amazon back in 2012. I do not want to go cheap on a mattress and hoping a good one will improve my sleep, so I have decided to invest in a nice TempurPedic.

I am looking at the ProAdapt line and particularly the Soft or Medium Hybrid. I went to the local mattress store and tried both of them, but could not tell much of a difference other than noticing the extra bounce that the Hybrid version has. I am a mix of side/back/stomach sleeper so I am not really sure which version would be best for me. It is hard to say from testing the mattresses out in the store which version would give me the better support I need. I really like the ProAdapt soft but want to make sure that the Hybrid version does not actually have the better support for a good night's sleep.

Any recommendations on which one would be better?"
"Need a new mattress.. Should I build one?. I weigh around 185, side/stomach sleeper with back issues. My chiropractor said I don't need anything \*special\* just comfortable for me.

I am on a college budget, so looking for under $400(+ or -) for a Twin XL.

I have been looking a lot of options but I keep coming back to building one. I am thinking about foam core with latex topper, but I am really unsure.

What do you guys think?

Thanks!!"
"Small staircase - King mattress options?. I'm currently trialing the Douglas mattress and thus far I'm just not sold. I previously had a Sealy Posturepedic Natural Essence pillow-top for 8 years that I loved for like 7 years which is a reasonable time to me. 

We went foam only because we wanted a king due to dog and toddler hogging space, but we just barely got the queen in and out the stairwell. 

Since I have already invested in the bed frame and headboard and can't return, any alternative ideas? 

  \- I am looking at the Logan & Cove hybrid but am not sure if I could fold it enough if I need to get it out? 

   \- I also read about hinged king mattresses but they don't seem to actually exist? haha

  \- Maybe a thicker better quality foam mattress? Canadian recommendations? Obviously Tempurpedic   
is better I assume but I'd like to stay in the $1500 range. 

\- Two twine XLs really ups the budget because they definitely aren't half the price and then there is the ridge...."
"Buyer beware with Nectar and Cocoon. We spent hours researching mattresses to try, reading tons of reviews and watching lots of videos. First we settled on the Nectar. Decided we couldn't go wrong with the 365 trial and free returns. Used it for a few weeks and it was way too hot for us. Figured we'd try something cooler, and moved the Nectar to another room while we tested the Cocoon Chill plush. It was definitely cooler, but not so plush. Ready to go back to our old spring mattress, we decided to start the return process.

Nectar - what a horrible mess. First they want you to donate it, which is great. Problem is nobody wants an old mattress, especially a king. We thought a truck would show up and pick it up but no, it's up to you to return it. After running out of options, we had to pay to get it disposed of and send a picture of it. The refund only came back $600 out of $1000!!! They deduct their ""free"" gifts out of the value, which in no way equate to $400. Seriously who charges for free gifts. This sounds criminal to me. 0 stars all around. The mattress is very nice and soft - but too warm and not conducive to our sleeping habits.

Cocoon - we're still working on the return to get a refund, but it's a similar process. We have more faith in this company, and they don't have the free gift shenanigans since none were included, but it's still a hassle.

Anyway, just wanted to get this out there. It isn't advertised nearly enough. The review sites mention the free returns, but not the process. But they are majorly biased since they get referral revenue.

We will never buy online again like this. We'll go back to Costco (like our first mattress). If you're lucky and get a mattress that works, great. If you want to exercise the trial and free return, be prepared for a lot of hassle and potential loss of money."
Brooklyn Bedding. Purchased a king bloom(medium firm) for around $1600 shipped on Memorial day. Got it in yesterday around 2ish. Unwrapped and didn't notice much of an off gassing smell that most people have described. It is a bit firmer than we anticipated but nothing crazy. Wife wanted to let it sit for the night before putting it in our bedroom. Will update over the next 30 days.
"Absolute coldest mattress possible. NO FOAM.. What mattress type is the coldest. I already know bedding materials make a difference. I have a tempur mattress and for a year have got the worst possible sleep ever due to overheating. I sleep better on a £20 airbed or on the floor.

I have done some research and it seems to be open spring, is that correct?"
"Waiting for Casper mattress delivery almost a month instead of several days. Is it happen only to me?

Each day I see UPS message: ""Package is delayed in transit. Delivery will be rescheduled."""
"Overwhelmed by options, underwhelmed by reviews for top brands (Tempurpedic, Tuft & Needle etc) Need some help. I slept on a couch for the first 24 years and finally had enough space for a bed. Went into a mattress retailer and was talked into buying a soft memory foam Serta ($1,200) that was amazing in the showroom and for the first month. Right after my return window closed, it started sinking and it's currently to the point where it's giving me some serious back pain and making some of my other sports injuries worse. I have tried flipping it, and setting on the floor which doesn't help.

&#x200B;

My budget is >5,000 ideally around 3,000. I think prefer medium (Current mattress is soft and there's no pressure, but I wake up with a lot of pain).

&#x200B;

I sleep extremely hot, and constantly move from my back to side and face down multiple times a night. I even wake up and sit-up against my window during sleep without realizing it. 

&#x200B;

I live in Hawaii and it's hot, but there's not many show rooms here and some online retailers return policy does not extend to my location.

&#x200B;

I was looking at Tempurpedic pro-adapt, but the reviews on Amazon were really bad. Checked Fakespot and they appeared legit.

&#x200B;

I've seen some bad things about tuft-and-needle post 90 day return window similar to this Serta mattress I have where it starts sinking.

I slept on a Zinus Green Tea memory foam mattress at an AirBnB I stayed at for a week and it was really nice, however, I expect it was brand new.

"Help with a Full size latex mattress (and bed base). I have been reading the posts and suggestions here and I find them quite helpful, I currently have a queen size bed with a very old spring mattress that needs replacing. I have lower back problems and occasional neck pain but I do prefer a medium firm mattress. My current living space makes a Full size probably ideal but I can’t find many options online. I’m willing to invest in a quality mattress but not go crazy so anything less than or around 1k would be great. Also, since most of the companies let you try them for several months, how would you move, return a heavy mattress? Is there a way to compress it back to a smaller size? Sorry for the long post and thank you!"
"Saatva zenhaven. Any reviews here? Positive or negative, would appreciate any information. Thank you!"
"Casper Wave Hybrid, one of the Tempurapedics, and sagging questions. We just moved to Birmingham, AL (from Iowa!) and we left our 13 year old king sized mattress behind. It had long ago developed the dreaded sagging, and our backs and hips hurt every morning. So now we will need to buy a new king sized mattress.

I hate buying mattresses. I'm one of those who read every review just to buy a toaster. But so many of the ""reviews"" I see online just seem like fluff with the goal of gaining revenue from click through purchases. And of course, none of them address what the bed will feel like in 3 months, in 6 months, in a year, in 3 years. Our problem in the past is that every King we buy (again last was 13 years ago!) very quickly develops the two ""valleys"" with the firm are in the middle between were my wife and I sleep. We're not skinny but not obese: around 170 - 180, 5'9 etc. All the mattresses we've purchased feel great in the store, but they all have very quickly sagged to form those valleys.

So. We have never had a memory foam mattress. Read some reviews and laid down on the top end Leesa hybrid, and the top end Casper Hybrid Wave (not the very newest one.) Preferred the feel of the Casper. But my brother has a Tempurapedic hybrid  he recently purchased and he raves about how great it is. He's not close enough for me to try it. I know Tempurapedics are more expensive, but if it is a bed I will love for 10 years, I'm willing to pay. And especially if it doesn't form sags/valleys in a King. 

I know this is impossible to answer, but is the Tempurapedic hybrid significantly ""better"" than the Casper Hybrid Wave? Will one last longer than the other? Will either or both of them avoid the ""sags""?

Thanks!"
"Pillow/Mattress Question. Age: 30 height: 5’9 weight: 190. have cervical spondylitis with myelopathy. I am currently using the Casper pillow and Casper Mattress (from 2017)right now. I like the feeling of it, but I have to be positioned just right to get a benefit. Is there a a better pillow and/or mattress anyone would suggest?"
"Build Your Own Mattress?. So I first heard about this concept on this sub recently, and went to a couple sites to investigate (diymattress.net  being one of them). I figured since my 5 year old $1,300 Sealy Posturepedic King isn't terribly old, I could open it up, discard pretty much everything but the springs. They are titanium twice tempered springs, so it is unlikely there is one iota of wear on them. The problem is when I price out a new zipper cover and some decent foam, the price is crazy. For the $700+ to do this work, and REUSE old springs, and not even have a solid return policy like Costco, it seems silly when I can buy a decent mattress from Costco for roughly the same price or a couple hundred more. It would be ALL new as well.

Am I missing something here? Perhaps is this site just too expensive? Change my mind! (I hope someone can, as I feel its a shame to discard the entire mattress due to a small area having wear)"
"Mattress for support. Looking to buy a new mattress that can provide good support and pressure relief. The cooling aspect would be a huge plus as well. Currently I am in between the brands below. Can you tell me your experience with them or what you would recommend?

Does this brand sleep hot? We live in the desert so..."
"Asked Lucid about ILD of their hybrid, got this confusing answer.. Their response: Thank you for reaching out to us. The Latex is Dunlop (20% natural and 80% synthetic). With advanced manufacturing and manipulation of foam, ILD is no longer a metric we recommend using. Instead, density is a better way to measure how soft or firm the mattress is. The top layer is 4.4 # and the support form is 1.6#.

"Help finding a type of a bed. Recently I was helping a friend move and saw he has a bed-frame that's super simple and easy to move around, and requires no assembly. It was handed down to him so he doesn't know where it was bought, and the frame itself has no maker label or anything else to identify it.

Here's some photos. Does anyone know what these types of bed frames are called? Anything that might help me Google to find it would be great. It's basically two upside-down L shaped pieces.

What mattress topper should I use for back pain?. I'm suffering from severe back pain. My mattress to too soft. I think it might be the cause behind the pain. Can't change the mattress.

"Looking at a new mattress in the next year.. I THOUGHT I was looking for a new mattress in the next year, LAST year, but now I’m for real.  My primary concern is hot sleeping, but I do like memory foam/latex.  I’m looking at the tempur proadapt, and tempur breeze, which has two variants, probreeze and luxe breeze.

I have a helix now and I enjoy the feel of a hybrid.  The probreeze claims 3 degrees cooler (than what?) and is available in a hybrid but lacks tempur apr.  the luxebreeze claims 8 degrees cooler, has “ventilated APR” (is this the same as proadapt?) but no hybrid option.  

Proadapt is simply described as “cool to the touch”

Anyone haggled with Casper?. I'm shopping and think I've settled on the Original Casper Hybrid and wondering if they are ever willing to come down on price at all.

"Mattress for side sleepers.. /r/mattress I have been looking for a new mattress.  So far, based on my research from the yearly top lists, the ones I'm leaning towards for me are Saavta luxury firm and Leesa.

Do you have any recommendations for this?"
"What mattress topper turns firm into medium-firm? My journey has been all over the place.... I've been trying to figure out mattresses while my body goes through injury cycles. I used T&N for years and LOVED it. But then I got some serious shoulder injuries, which led to back problems, and it was too firm.

I made a rookie mistake and instead of getting a topper, I bought a soft pillowtop (free adjustable base and I'd just gotten a new job and could afford it). It was GREAT for a year. Then it was too soft. I couldn't make a pillowtop more firm no matter what I tried. I'm selling it off and my roommate sold me her firm Ikea for cheap because she was moving out of state.

While it was better than the pillowtop, it's too firm. I just want a medium-firm again now that my body is relatively normal. I don't want a new mattress, just a topper. But there are no medium-firm toppers that I can find. 

Does anyone have experience putting a topper on a firm Ikea bed? I'm a back and side sleeper. I have a dual sided foam pillow that's great so it's all about the body (specifically my back). I'm tiny (115 to 120 lbs, usually). Do I just get a 3"" medium topper and hope for the best? What's eco-friendly but affordable? I don't want to return anything because I know it'll end up in a landfill. Thank you in advance!"
"Best mattress for a guest room. I'm looking to buy a queen mattress for a guest bed.

Our bed frame is really low, so we would need to get a boxspring to raise it up...that's definitely a consideration in our cost analysis.

"Basic metal bed frame + plywood?. Hi everyone. I bought a nice novaform memory foam mattress from costco that i am happy with.

"Original Mattress Factory. Never have I had such back pain!  Throwing away my old (well-made, as they were 15 years ago...) mattress was, I learned, the worst mistake I've made in recent memory.  Buying a mattress from OMF to replace it was a HUGE mistake.  I've been searching for a decent mattress (finding no-one makes a decent mattress anymore - they stopped making the reliable, comfortable ones about 15 years ago-sigh) for 1 1/2 years now while struggling with the Original Mattress Factory mattress and dealing with worsening pain while I search.  DO NOT BUY A MATTRESS FROM THEM!  I have a queen-sized mattress and it got a decent dip in the middle within a month.  I had exchanged the first one I purchased (a plush with topper), so I had no recourse when the valley in the middle showed up.  Still searching for something that won't give this 72-year-old female so much pain.  Using a tens unit on my lower back every single day now.  And with Covid out there, shopping is a no-go.  Just wanted to warn people about the horrible quality of the mattresses at OMF."
"Good Mattresses at Sleep Outfitters. I bought what I was hoping would be a nice mattress 3 years ago, didn't do a lot of research at the time, but is unfortunately having a lot of sag. Fortunately it was covered under warranty and now I have $800 of store credit to Sleep Outfitters.

I would like to not repeat my old mistakes and I read through the FAQ, but was wondering if anyone knew of any decent mattresses at Sleep Outfitters. I'm hoping not to have to spend much over the store credit I have, but could go up 1300 if needed. I'm a side sleeper, and don't believe in a bed being too soft (never understood why Goldilocks didn't stick to the second bed), so does anyone have any tips/thoughts? Thanks!"

Recommendation. Hello to all . I have horrible mattress( sterns and foster ) that was WAY TOO expensive in its time it was supposed to be firm and now it’s like a pancake also it’s super hot to sleep on it. I spent my pregnant days sleeping on an air mattress due to this horrible mattress would make me sooooo sore on my hips.So I spent good$$$ on this and now I really need to change it for a more affordable option. I know sealy is not very famous  on this reddit. But any recommendation can help I just want something without memory foam where I can sleep with the hubby
"I recently got a Zinus Mattress on Amazon and accidentally made a small tear in the mattress cover while opening it. I've read this is bad and could cost me more in the long run. Is it a worse idea to ""double bag it"" with another mattress cover?. So I read online that tearing a mattress cover is bad to begin with, and apparently this brand of mattress has fiberglass or something in it that gets out when you rip the mattress cover. I don't want the tear to get bigger over time as I toss and turn on it and give the mattress wear and tear. I also read to NEVER take the cover off of a Zinus mattress, it will ruin it and let out said fiber glass. By this logic, double bagging it seems to be the move, I'll just slip the new cover over the existing one that's torn.   


Does this logic make sense here? I'm broke, I don't want to buy a new mattress. Also, does it really matter what kind of mattress cover I get? [This](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q7EPSHI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is the bed I got.  


Thanks :)"
"Too good to be true?. Hey guys,

We are looking to buy a mattress. I was looking on our local Nextdoor to see if anybody actually lists older mattresses for free for someone in need, or if we should just dump it.

I saw this post from this guy in my area selling premium brands (Sapphire and Nectar) mattresses brand new with free pillows for extremely cheap (new in box). Sapphire queen for $450 and Nectar for $350. I could not find anything about the Sapphire mattress besides their official website and they cost between $2,000-$4,000...
I did a bit of searching and found that this guy is local, has been selling mattresses for over a year and actually has a tiny store front where he has a few piles of the mattresses expanded. On his private Facebook page he claims to have many different name brands, but there is no comments from people.
Is there such a thing as counterfeit market with mattresses....?"

I'm in an interesting dilemma because so far, I've slept hard through the night every night with it, but every morning, I wake up with back pain (which is very abnormal, never had that issue before).

I added a cheap topper to my mattress a couple of years ago but it's already getting worn out. I weigh 95lbs and am a side sleeper. I don't want something very firm/hard, but a mattress that I can sink into causes hip pain. A mattress that prevents partner disturbance yet still has some bounce (when needed..) would be ideal.

My boyfriend and I are looking at moving in together after we graduate in December and, unfortunately, my wonderful lovely queen sized mattress that I love and adore is also like, 20 years old.

We don't really want a super firm mattress, we would probably prefer a medium one. I've looked at a few, like Tuft and Needle and Brooklyn Bedding. We'll probably be purchasing around Labor Day for the sales, and our budget would probably be $1,000 or so (preferably less, and with Brooklyn Bedding we could get close to that with sales and student discounts). 
Also, if it helps, my current mattress is an innerspring pillowtop. I'm pretty sure the exact make is the Serta Sovereign Pillowtop (with pillowtop on both sides). It's sadly discontinued so I cannot repurchase that one, but if anyone is familiar with it and knows one similar or has a completely different suggestion that would be great. 
Thanks in advance, and if you need any other information please let me know!"

"FYI: Casper having order fulfillment / customer service meltdown.. I ordered from Casper two weeks ago. The shipment never arrived, and I'm getting the run around from their customer service. There are 45 min wait times for phone calls and email/text go unanswered. Customers outside the US don't appear to be able to contact Casper at all.

Looking on Twitter (search ""Casper"" or ""Casper customer service""), there seem to be many others experiencing this issue. I personally was told that UPS has my mattress, and they need to ""Call UPS and then get back to me"", but it never happens. I called UPS myself eventually, and all they told me was that they were unable to deliver the mattress, and since I'm not the sender, they cannot provide me with any more info.

I finally decided to just get a refund. After waiting on hold forever w/ Casper, I got through, and the representative told me that they could not refund me without receiving the mattress back first. Since it was never delivered, I can't make that happen - from my perspective, the problem is between UPS and Casper. Casper just took my money without fulfilling my order.

I initiated a chargeback with my bank, and filed a complaint on the Better Business Bureau website.

"Avocado Mattress, Topper, and Pillows Review. There seem to be a lot of overtly paid mattress review sites out there, and the vendors themselves seem to cull everything but the positive reviews from their site. Even on this subreddit there are people chiming in with reviews for things they ""intend"" to purchase...whatever the point of that is. I thought I'd offer a real review since I just got a new mattress from Avocado and I've seen some questions on it.

**What I got:**    
Avocado Green Mattress - King    
Plush Topper - King    
Avocado Green Pillows - King

**Review**:    
Ordering was a simple experience, directly through [https://www.avocadogreenmattress.com/shop](https://www.avocadogreenmattress.com/shop). I got the mattress in about a week, the pillows followed 3 days after, and the plush topper 2 days after that. So everything arrived within 2 weeks of order, no fuss.

The mattress is very ""handsome"" in and of itself, but I don't know anyone (including myself) who sleeps on a bare mattress without putting sheets on it. So the aesthetic of the mattress is a plus, but not a practical benefit. It's a little firmer than I expected, though I did expect it to be somewhat firm based on some reviews. I'd categorize it as ""on the firm side of comfortable."" I was hoping adding the plush topper would up the softness a bit, but in my experience it made it even more firm (and trapped heat). I absolutely hated the topper and couldn't sleep on it after 2 nights of trying. Avocado didn't give me any trouble about issuing a refund for the topper since it didn't meet my expectations; it's currently back in the box waiting for a FedEx pickup.

The pillows are of good quality, but again on the firm side of comfortable. I'm a stomach sleeper and they're too dense for me as-is. For now I've switched back to my old cheap pillow that is pretty flat, and I'll try removing some of the stuffing from my Avocado pillow to calibrate for my own sleeping style.

**Overall**:    
I only buy a new mattress every 10 years or so, and I went with a top dollar option this time because it's so rare that I spend out on this stuff and because quality sleep is important to me. While I don't regret going with Avocado, after 2 weeks of sleeping on the mattress and experiencing some of their other products, I probably wouldn't buy it again. If it were significantly discounted, maybe. But for now the premium they charge is more reflective of their ""green charter"" than overall comfort."
"Cutting a Purple mattress down to size?. I've had my king size purple mattress for a couple of years. It's still in great condition, and I'm a fan.

"Purple 3 Mattress Review - 2 Months. Hello all!

As the title suggests, I have had my Purple mattress for around two months now.  Those months have been in quarantine, and for a decent amount of quarantine my bed was the only furniture in my room (sudden pandemic-caused move), so I have spent *many* hours a day in this bed--like, frequently 16+ per day, probably more in the beginning.

**I am** 5'5"" (165cm) and weigh around 145lb (64.2kg).  I have wide hips and little to no history of back problems.  I sleep on my side, usually close to the edge, and tend to prefer a softer mattress.  I sleep rather cold.  

I purchased the Purple 3 in a full size.  It came with free sheets and a free standard Purple pillow (not the fancy type).  I purchased a second at discount because the bed is big enough to be shared, and I supplemented with two additional $6 Target pillows for the sham cases.

**Initial thoughts on delivery:**
The pillows/sheets were delivered separate from the mattress, which was weird but understandable.  The mattress also came a day later than initially estimated, but this was peak pandemic-time, so I'm not worried about it.  

The mattress arrived rolled up.  There was no signing-off or anything, which was somewhat concerning given the pricetag--it was just left on my doorstep.  I live in a rowhome in a big city, and it could very easily have been stolen.  (I'd also just received a bedframe from Ikea two days prior, so the whole experience was definitely measured against that and found Extremely Lacking.)  It was very heavy, and I needed help from my roommate to carry it up the stairs to my room.  There were many, *many* layers of plastic to remove, but the mattress expanded to full size with very little coaxing or time once the vacuum seal was removed, and I was able to sleep on it the same night.

The [standard] pillows are Fine, nothing remarkable--noticeably fuller and firmer than the $6 ones from Target, but I'm sure you can get a better pillow for the $40 sticker price.  

The sheets are ridiculous, don't bother: they're made from this terrible stretch material that is nearly T-shirty.  Like, Ma'am.  I just dropped thousands of dollars on this mattress, I can drop another $30 on some microfiber sheets.  I never even put them on the bed, I ended up handing them off to a roommate who accepted them.

**The first two weeks** on this mattress were honestly hellish.  I have never experienced back and neck pain the way I did initially, and my mattress where I last lived was three inches of stuffed padding on the floor.  I tried switching to my back to alleviate some of the discomfort, I tried using only one pillow...nothing seemed to help.  It was awful, and I was getting prepared to return itand go back to sleeping on the couch.

**The third/fourth week,** I noticed that it was much more comfortable and that I had no trouble falling asleep at all, which has continued to be the case since.  I always sleep/chill and relax on the same side of my bed, so the other side has barely been used.  Out of curiosity, I have crawled over to compare, and the side I use is noticeably softer and pliant amd more sunken-in.  I like this, but if you buy this mattress expecting it to feel just as firm after the first several weeks you are in for a very unpleasant surprise.

I have had very rare issues with overheating, but I also have a mattress cover on (so the mattress doesn't stain or anything) and was in full pajamas both times; I also sleep extremely cold, though, so take that for what it's worth.

Their warranty is pretty good from what I've seen in my research, so I figure that if it does further deteriorate over the next ten years it'll probably be well-within that X-inch sag mark by the time it bothers me, and I'll be able to get my refund without any issues.

I'll probably check in around either the hundred-day mark or the six-month mark with another update.  In the meantime, I hope this helps!"
"Need Advice. Hello all! Thanks in advance for any and all replies.

"Temporary mattress needed(3 months) prior to a move, with plans to get a more permanent one soon after. Hey all,

So i'm in a weird spot where i am on an old, cheap mattress that i think anything would be an improvement over. This served me well for a while, but over the last year or so it's just lost all good qualities and has been leading to painful sleeping - mostly with my hips and shoulders. I have no history of hip issues outside of the recent discomfort from sleeping(it's now resulting in daytime pain, whereas before it was only right when i woke up)

I also am moving soon - in August. My room right now is too small for an upgrade in size, which I want - but for now, i want to replace it with a mattress that is good for side/stomach sleepers, cheap, and light. The plan will be to replace it when i move into the new place. 

I've tried to stick it out for a while, but it's really really bad and i don't want to end up wishing i spent $300 on a cheap throwaway vs any other more expensive treatments should this cause any issues. 

My ideal situation:

1. Get new mattress delivered, old one removed. 
2. Sleep on it for 3 months
3. Get rid of it somehow 
4. Repeat but with a high quality larger mattress
5. Sleep on it for 8-10 years

If i need to move with it, i'd like it to be a light mattress so probably a spring mattress. I don't want to have to move something heavy - and will buy one of those in a few months. 

I'm probably about 50% side sleeper, 40% stomach sleeper and 10% back sleeper. No other requirements other than it being cheap, temporary, lightish in weight, a 'full' mattress, and comfortable for just sleep right now. In Aug/Sept i will upgrade, with a queen size mattress. 

I see a bunch of sales, but don't know what is good on the low end. It doesn't need to last, but also hopefully won't need 120 days to break in."

"Members Mark adjustable bed base. I recently purchased a queen size member's mark adjustable bed base after shopping all of the local mattress stores looking for a solution that would not cost an arm and a leg.

I paid $499 for this base on Sam's club and just set it up today.

I have to say what an amazing value purchase. 

My local mattress firm was selling a similar spec base for over $2,000.

Set up is very easy, the unit is very high quality extremely quiet great features great buy.

Do not get sucked into spending thousands of dollars on something you can buy from Sam's club for a relatively inexpensive price.

This base fit perfectly into my existing queen size frame which has a headboard, I was shocked that it fits so well, it looks like it could be on the showroom of a mattress store.

I paired it with a sleep Ez 360 hybrid latex mattress which ran me $1,085, firm latex on one side medium latex on the other. (The 360 allows you to select the firmness of each side top of the mattress via interchangeable inserts, it's not as scary as it might sound)

So for under $1,600 I got a hybrid latex mattress with the queen size adjustable base great deal! Can't wait to sleep on it.

Sleep ez even threw in two latex pillows.

"My Nectar Order Experience. I have replied to a few thread on here about my terrible experience with Nectar, but I wanted to lay it all out from start to finish in one place. 

&#x200B;

I was looking for king sized mattress that I could get delivered and wouldn't have too much trouble getting to a second floor myself. I also didn't want to mess with a box spring. So, after some online searched and comparisons of Nectar, Purple, etc., I figured Nectar's price point and their at the time claim to deliver in 2-3 days was perfect for my needs. The ""extras"" were just icing on the cake. 

Ordering online was very easy. I always use a credit card because I am a miles junky and I like the extra purchase protection. I am glad I did this time too. 

After the order all seemed well. I ordered near the end of a week and the weekend came and passed and I din't think much of it. Then about midway through next week I still had not received any tracking info and certainly didn't receive the mattress, I was a little concerned.  It was right in the middle of the initial Covid fiasco, so I figure a couple days late on top of the 3 day promise was fine. 

Then the nightmare began. 

I received the infamous, ""Your Order #XXXXXXX Is Running Behind"" email. The only info it really had was what I ordered along with the note, ""There was an issue with your order, we’ll provide more details soon"".

So, I waited a few more days and never received anything. 

I then sent emails to any Nectar email address I could find. And, then I followed up. And, then I followed up again. 

A week or so passed and they all were ignored. 

So, I hopped on live chat and there was a queue of about 300 people. The first time I tried the queue would go down then back up. It did that for a couple hours and never dipped below the 250 mark. 

I tried again the next day and still a queue of about 200+, but I did get someone on the chat. They promised me the order would ship ""soon"" but couldn't give an exact date. 

Later that night a tracking number came through from UPS. I didn't think too much of it and was just happy things were on their way. I was wrong. 

A few days later I got a package. It was the sheets and nothing else. I felt duped. I feel they did this to claim the have the order in the works and to give a little breathing room. And, also make it harder to cancel. 

I then did the whole live chat thing again to ask about the mattress. I got a bizarre run around about not being able to tell me when it would ship. I then asked to cancel but they said I could not because they shipped the order to a warehouse. They could only cancel it when it arrived. 

So, they didn't ship it but they shipped it, but they didn't have info, but they couldn't cancel it, and just all around nonsense. I immediately asked to cancel again and they just closed the chat. 

Luckily, I saved every email and took screenshots of the chat support plus had the transcripts emailed to me. 

I jumped right to my CC portal and filed a dispute. 

Surprisingly enough, then I finally got a reply to my email I sent way back in the beginning. Again they tried to give me some run around about warehouses and they couldn't cancel the order until they got it to a warehouse etc. 

I told them I was filing a dispute (they told me not too as it would ""take longer to get my money back""), and eventually they gave in and said they would cancel the order. I am happy to have had that in the email too. 

But, here's the kicker. Two days later I got a FedEx tracking number. They tried to send me the mattress AFTER they told me they canceled the order (never got email verification, only the rep's in-line claim they cancelled) and AFTER I filed a dispute. 

So, I called FedEx to tell them I will refuse the delivery (they were totally cool with things and explained the process). 

Then I had to ask the Nectar Rep (multiple times) to send a UPS return label for the sheets to ensure they didn't try to stick me with some oddball fee for that. I called UPS too and they said if the merchant didn't supply them to let them know because I was in the refusal period. 

A few weeks later my credit card came back and said I won the dispute and closed the whole matter. 

The craziest thing about the whole mess was if they would have been straight from the beginning and if the chat rep would not have just ghosted me, I would have waited the extra few weeks. Heck, they could have simply tossed in a $50 refund or something just to keep me on the line. 

But, instead they did everything in their power to obfuscate their lies about advertised delivery times.  

FWIW, Nectar is one brand of beds sold by their mother company Resident."
"Casper are closing down in the UK, everything is 60% off and being restocked in limited quantities, so I wrote a script to send me notifications when anything I want comes back in stock. https://github.com/samuelwcm/casper-backinstock"
"So close to just closing my eyes and pointing at a random mattress. Looking for a new mattress and entered this rabbit hole of hell. I have a Serta Plush pillow Top mattress now and it's fine but I'm moving and will be putting it in the guest room so that I can get a new mattress. A friend bought a Sleepy's Gel Memory Foam Mattress from Mattress Firm online. It felt HEAVENLY when I tried it but shipping takes 6+ weeks right now AND apparently my research is telling me that Sleepy's quality is shit. 

So I went to a Mattress Firm yesterday to try out their beds. I decided I want a Hybrid and the only one that feels great is the Sealy's Silver Chill Firm Hybrid that's like $1.7k. I'm close to buying it but OF COURSE my research is telling me that Sealy's is also crap. And that basically EVERYTHING is crap unless you pay $3k+ for a temperpedic. 

I'm so close to just closing my eyes and ordering a bed-in-the-box bed online (like a GhostBed Flex) and be miserable later when/if I decide I hate it....

UPDATE: I went to a couple more stores today and was able to haggle a Sealy Copper II Plush for $600 less than what they were asking for. Was it still worth the price? Will it last the next 3 years? Are there other better and cheaper mattresses? I dont know but I'll let y'all know in 2 years. Or a month, we'll see...."
What happened to Addable?. We bought three excellent beds from them.  Their website is not available.
"Anyone have experience with the Sealy Hybrid Silver Chill 14"" mattress?. I'm currently looking at this mattress and would love honest reviews!"
"I WILL NEVER BUY FROM NECTAR AGAIN, HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. TLDR; Horrible experience with Nectar. Tracking on packages is extremely inaccurate to almost useless, comparable to a blind man trying to navigate you through the bottom of the ocean. Packages arrived at random times, tracking no use at all. All my packages (Mattress, adjustable frame, sheets, and mattress protector all arrived at random times for about 2 months.) Getting in contact with Nectar is like trying to contact them through a signal fire. Call hours are misleading, online chat support seems to have a very low staff number often times leaving you waiting for over 2 hours to speak with someone, if you are lucky. (Sometimes they just cutoff the time and everyone who is waiting has to try again the next day.) The instructions they gave me to build my adjustable frame do not apply to my adjustable frame, nor do the images resemble my frame at all. The adjustable frame box came missing the proper components to assemble. I literally have 4 cords that do not connect to anything. And to top it off, even if I did have everything to my adjustable frame, they did not send me a remote to operate it at all. NOT TO MENTION MY ADJUSTABLE FRAME HAS A LITERAL HOLE IN IT. Never buying from NECTAR ever again. Horrible customer service.

Edit: Reposted link, old link missing photos. 

Hello everyone, I don't usually post on here, but the customer service and delivery of anything from Nectar have been absolutely horrible. So I'd like to weigh in a bit. After sleeping on a bad mattress for quite a while now, I decided to place an order for a nectar mattress, on May 2nd, 2020. I was told that my mattress would be delivered within 3-5 days, which was great. Once tracking came out, my mattress was expected to be at my house on May 7th. It was not there on May 7th. Then I rechecked the tracking, and there was no information available. It was just gone, poof. I checked the next day, and it was said to be at my house on May 12th. It did not arrive on May 12th. It did not arrive on May 13th. It arrived on May 14th. However, only my MATTRESS arrived on May 14th. When I placed my order, I had ordered an adjustable frame, the mattress itself, and I was to be given sheets, and a mattress protector as well. I only received my mattress. I received my sheets about two days ago (May 18th), and the whereabouts of my adjustable frame or mattress protector is completely unknown. There is no tracking available, all that is said is ""FedEx will update you when they receive the shipment from the company."" Which leads me to believe that Nectar has not send my orders to FedEx.

Today June 12th 2020, over a month since I placed my order was I finally able to get my entire order, the  adjustable frame  and the (free) mattress protector finally came in. You'd think all would be great and dandy at that point, but no. I had to reach out to them before June 12th to even get any information as the tracking of my package was completely unknown to anyone. Even Nectar had no idea where my mattress was. They just said ""we're working on getting it out to you,"" this was last week. It took a month to finally process my order? My order has been on ""pending"" for the last month, so absolutely no one had any idea where anything was. I was just pissed because I had to reach out to the company to simply ask where my package was. They didn't contact me at all telling me about the delay in order, it was only until I contacted them a THIRD time did they actually put me on a direct link of communication of any changes in the status of my order. (I should also add, contacting them is like trying to light a fire underwater. Their online chat service is completely bull crap as it seems they only have one associate working because there are times where you are the 80th person in line, and I've waited until I was about 10 people away from my spot. Next thing you know, I get a message that says, ""We're sleeping right now, please feel free to email us."" Guess what? I've tried that, and they do not respond to their emails.)  Along with that, when my adjustable frame finally came in today, IT WAS MISSING PARTS. Literally 2-3 of the cables don't even attach to anything. The instruction sheet that they gave me does not even pertain to my adjustable frame. The motors are different, the instructions refer to actuator box that ISN'T EVEN ON MY FRAME AT ALL. NOT TO MENTION THE ADJUSTABLE FRAME HAS A HOLE IN IT! They have instructions for me to do things that aren't even on my frame, and along with that, they didn't even send all the right pieces. I don't even have remote to operate my mattress correctly if they just so happen to send me all the godforsaken parts to the actual adjustable frame. I tried calling them to solve the issue, their hours are from 9am-9PM Mon-Fri. It's a Friday today, it's 4pm. All I heard was ""You've tried to contact us outside our usual business hours, please try again or email us."" Remember, they don't answer their emails either. So basically, for lack of a better term, I'm ""fucked"" until they actually contact me or pick up their phone, answer their emails, or have a chat room that I don't have to wait 2 godforsaken hours in to talk to someone. AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE MATTRESS THAT MUCH, IT'S HARD AS HELL. (That's aside from the point though, I don't care too much that I don't like the mattress, the customer support and the lack of the ability to track anything was enough to post this.)"
"Is purple the best online mattress?. This year, my wife and I have really buckled down to get a new bed. We had a lousy mattress we had gotten from art van in 2014 that we couldn't stand anymore. We ordered a mint hybrid from tuft and needle and tried it out. I liked it but my wife didn't seem to care for it. Then we tried a casper hybrid... I liked it but it was still not the right fit for her. We were going to send back the mint and they offered to send us a free topper for it and so then we sent the casper back. We have tried the topper and it has helped my wife a little bit but she still isn't really in love with the mattress. I am wodnering about trying purple. All along, I kind of wanted to but they seem to be the most expensive. We have a king size bed and when I look at purple, I wonder what do I get... The 2""? 3? 4? Is there a noticeable comfort difference between the 2 and the 3? The 3 and the 4? Anyone with any thoughts I'd love to get them. I need to initiate the return of the mint mattress in a few days so we will probably be sleeping in the guest room until the next mattress arrives ha.

Thanks!"

"Split Firmness Cal King that isn't two separate mattresses.... Had a Kingsdown for 10+ years that is need of replacement. Really like having split firmness, but I'm seeing a lot of the companies that offer this are actually just selling two different twin mattresses. I liked that the Kingsdown was one whole mattress (has a strip of memory foam in the middle to connect the two sides). 

The only one I've seen so far is Nest. We aren't opposed to memory foam but want to stay away from the glorified air mattresses (sleep number). Any recs?"
"Help regarding memory foam mattress and bed frame. So I just got a bed and bed frame. I have the memory foam already expanding on the frame and ive been testing it to see how it feels. So far the mattress seems to slip under the bed frame if I lay on it. Im not sure if it is doing this because I need a box spring or not but people have stated in reviews that you dont need one. 

The bed in question is [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HN7VWFK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1). And the frame is [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EYN1NEG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Just for reference, I got both a queen's bed and queen bed frame. 

I rather not buy a box spring right now if I dont need to. If anyone knows what may be causing this please help.   


Btw, I know the dimensions for the width are wider for the frame than the bed but I tried pushing it in some and it still seems to have the issue of sinking."
"What is the best process for finding your perfect mattress. This is for my wife and I.

"Please take pity on a pregnant lady and help me pick a desperately-needed mattress, particularly for pregnancy.. I have been hopeful that I would either come to a conclusion reading online and/or finally get the chance to try out in store, neither of which is working out.

I’m getting increasingly more pregnant and less sleep as time goes on, please help! Reading and watching reviews I feel more confused than ever. I’m also worried about some of the companies I originally considered (nectar & dreamcloud) since they’re not showing up via delivery.

- I’m normally about 130 lbs (now 150) my partner is around 200
- I change positions throughout the night, my partner side sleeps (also throughout pregnancy you are supposed to side sleep only, which I try to do, currently via pillow propping)
- I’ve read that it’s good to consider ease of getting out of the bed for pregnancy, esp during my recovery 
- I can spend between 700-1200, but would like to save if possible
- allergen-friendly/eco-friendly and minimal off-gassing isn’t a must but is definitely a bonus
- originally I was looking for an organic or natural hybrid but now researching I’m not sure that’s the way to go; I’ve also had memory foam and liked it

I would seriously appreciate any advice or info you guys have to offer. ??"

"the mattress feels different than in-store. I recently bought a new innerspring euro top mattress, but now that I have it feels totally different from how it felt at the store. At the store, it felt very soft. almost like it had a memory foam type of material but the one I got is so stiff and offers no comfort at all. I took a picture of the tag beforehand and it seems to match up to the one I received. 

is this a matter of just breaking it in? did anyone have a similar experience with their mattress? thanks in advance"
"Nolah vs Purple for side sleeper.. I have been looking at a few box beds now. 

I'm undecided between the purple mattress and the nolah mattress. I'm primarily a side sleeper. I go to sleep on my side and wake up on my side. I have scoloios and pregnant so I'm looking for a bed that is not too firm. 

My fiancee is a bigger guy. About 300 pounds and is mostly a stomach/side sleeper. We live in Arizona and want something to cool us while we are sleeping. 

For anyone that lives in a hot climate, which bed did you prefer? I been looking at different reviews online and on Reddit but wanted to see the opinions of those who actually live where its insufferable during the summer."

Want to buy a topper, but unsure of what to get. Have heard that SleepOnLatex is a pretty good option. But I'm not sure which topper is best. Should I get the 2 inch soft topper or 3 inch medium topper?

I'm 5'11'', weigh 175lbs, and sleep in all positions (stomach and side mostly, but sometimes back as well. I switch positions a lot throughout the night)."
"First time college student back pain indecisive budget. Hi all. I have been researching lots of mattresses. for the past 5 years, I have used a 4in or so mattress foam topped on very terrible firm spring dorm mattresses. I am now moving to a place I must buy my own mattress. I sleep on my side and have terrible lower back pain. I was looking into the snuggle-pedic(a bit out of my price range) and the icoil zinus memory foam hybrid cooling gel mattress. I honestly have been of the mindset that a good topper fixes everything and have gotten plenty of compliments on the comfort of my bed so I am a tad conflicted. I haven’t yet gone into a mattress store but I am afraid that just laying on a mattress for 20 minutes is not the same as sleeping on it all night long. Any input would be greatly appreciated."
Queen size mattress on a full size adjustable frame - good idea or not?. I have a fairly new full size mattress and adjustable bed frame.  I want to keep the frame and go up to a queen size mattress.  Any ideas on the feasibility of this?
"Is this a good plan to refurbish a mattress with a Tempurpedic topper?. My current mattress is about 9 years old but 4 years were in a storage unit, so it's had about 5 years of use. I'm 6'5, 190 lbs, side sleeper with a Lumina ""Spirit Luxury Firm"" mattress that is not showing any dips or sagging. I think it has 0.5"" latex and maybe some other foam comfort layers based on the label. It feels too firm on my shoulders now. I saw some videos from Jeff Scheuer that make me think my comfort layers are worn out but the innerspring is ok. My cover also has some stains.

I'm went to a mattress store today to get an idea of what I might like, and I was surprised how much I liked a Tempurpedic mattress. I was on it for about 10 minutes and it didn't get hot like I expected. Unfortunately I have not found a mattress with latex around Panama City FL.

My plan is to buy a Tempurpedic topper and strip my mattress down to the innerspring, get a new cover, and place the topper on top. Is this a good or bad plan? Or should I keep it simple and just put it on top (as the name implies)?

Thanks for any help!"
"How to find bed frames for odd mattress size?. So my friend gave me a mattress that they had so I wouldn’t have to buy one when I moved near them, they told me it was a full. So I brought it to my new apartment and set everything up but I noticed something was off. The bed frame was a little longer than the mattress. 

No big deal, I guess they had a different size bed frame, but when I went to put the full size sheets on the bed, I had to really work to get them on and they didn’t fit perfectly. 

Long story short, I dug around for the Tag and found out that it was 60x75 or an rv sized queen mattress.

So the sheets are easy enough to find on amazon but does anyone have a recommendation for what I could do for the frame?"

"Please help me out of revolving BiB. My old mattress unfortunately crapped out a few weeks before shelter in place started, and I'm incredibly high risk so we can't go to a mattress store and try something out before we buy it. We also don't have much $$ so bed in boxes have been ideal only in that they're easy to get full refunds when I don't really know what I need. 

I am hovering around 130 lbs, my husband is a little over 160. We both side sleep. He's comfortable on virtually anything. I have a nerve condition and sleep VERY hot. It also causes nerve flare ups exacerbated by beds that aren't right in firmness. 

We started with the Purple, but I was too light for it. I could painfully feel every single honeycomb and the feeling of never quite being still made gave me terrible vertigo. We lasted one night. We tried two different versions of Zinus to see if a thicker one would help. These actually slept cool to us but both were way too firm and god the smell, weeks later wouldn't go away. Then we got a Helix Sunset. TOO plush and felt cheaply made, to be honest. We kept rolling toward the center of the bed and waking up in pools of sweat. Got a Sealy Cocoon Chill ""soft"". Perfect temperature, way too firm. My arm was numb every single day, after a month of trying to let it break in. Currently have the Lytton Plush, which my husband loves. I don't find it to be temperature neutral, something no one else has mentioned but I wake up sweating EVERY morning. Not sure if there's a way to mitigate this, the company gave me the ""gee no one's ever said this before"" line and with as hidden as reviews for them are, I don't trust it. If I'm being honest the Lytton still feels a bit firm for me but I'm not sure we could go softer without sacrificing support or something that's good for both my husband and me. 

I'll take any advice or recommendations. We're having trouble because mattress stores keep pushing highest price points possible on us and Sleep Sherpa showroom (who we've talked to but not been into) keeps saying the Lytton should work and to keep waiting. If anyone knows of a perfect mattress I just have to get from a store I'm all ears at this point. I'm so over this constant revolving door and know more about mattresses and pillows than I ever wanted to know."

"well I just had a really shitty experience with Luma sleep customer service.   
I've been researching mattresses for about a week and had almost settled on Luma, but I called because I had a few questions about the split king topper for the hybrid system and the density of the NRG foam in their materials.  I was trying to decide between their two hybrid systems and also if I should upgrade to Talalay latex.

I spoke with someone I believe named Stefano.  He answered my questions regarding the split king.  He asked me additional questions about my and my husband's height and weight (5'3 250, 5'9 170) and then recommended your all latex system. When I told him I would need to discuss with my husband since it was about $600 more than the mattress we were considering, he told me that because of my size your company would not honor the 100 night sleep trial or warranty.  I was flabbergasted but as I have been researching thoroughly, I said there was nothing like this in the terms and conditions.  He said they would just refuse to take my order and recommended I find a different mattress company before hanging up on me.

I was not rude or angry this entire call.  Frankly I was a bit too stunned to react.  I cannot fathom why their associate treated me this way.  I was specifically interested in the company because of the honesty in details regarding construction and materials and the recommendations from other folks online as to the construction.

Frankly, I was left speechless.  It is one thing entirely to recommend a different mattress based on someone's specific body, it is entirely another thing to treat someone as though they have no worth because of their weight."

"How do Latex and Innerspring Hybrid or All Latex mattresses compare?. I am almost done with my mattress search - but i have been stuck trying to figure out what are the pros and cons of all latex vs latex innerspring combo.

My search, based on my sleeping style, (back and side) and my size (200lbs 5'8) currently led me to 

* Sleep on Latex 9"" (Medium or Firm)
* Sleep EZ Hybrid
* Avocado (without pillow-top)

The Sleep EZ Hybrid seems to be a cheaper, non organic certified version of the Avocado - but I don't know much more than that.  Sleep on Latex is all latex and is what SOL is.  

Your insight is appreciated."
"New to a firm mattress; is this normal?. I used to have standard coiled mattress with a super fluffy memory foam pillow top.  Thinking I needed more support, my new mattress is fully memory foam, though firm (with one of those fancy vibrating and moving bases).  I notice that I'm slightly sore at the pressure points - shoulders and hips, and slightly on the rib cage - when I wake.  Is this normal for a firm mattress?  I don't know if I am just missing the super comfortable fluffiness and need to get used to the firm mattress, or if the firm mattress isn't right for me.  

I have about one week left in my 120-day policy to exchange my new mattress."

"Normal for dip to form on new mattress?. Hi All,

I recently got the Avocado Green Mattress w/ pillow top.  It has been about two weeks now and there is almost an inch dip where my hip is positioned.  I am 153 pounds and a side sleeper.  Is it normal for a dip to start forming that early?

The last memory foam mattress I had lasted about three years before I started waking up with back pain.  I had the same issue of a huge dip (over 1.5 inches) where my hip would be positioned.

After all the research I have done regarding materials, I thought pocketed coils and latex would be a good combo that would last a significant amount of time before a dip becomes a problem.  Am I wrong to assume something like that?"

"Latex mattress replacing current mattress - use box spring or no. We're looking at replacing our current queen pillow top mattress with a latex mattress, most likely from Arizona Premium Mattress. Since we'll just be purchasing the cores and topper, does this go on top of our current box spring that is sitting in a bed frame? 

If we didn't use the box spring and put the cores in the frame, the bed wouldn't be very high off the ground.

Thanks"
"Casper closed down in Europe and I'm desperate.. Hi guys, so the deal is that apparently Casper closed down in Europe. I have a Casper and absolutely love it, however since I met my girlfriend I just need a bigger mattress. I'm also really tall, my current casper mattress is 2.20m x 1.40m. I wanted to get a 2.20x2.0m one but with Casper gone I just feel lost as to what to get."
Idle Sleep Experience. Just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience with Idle Sleep.  We made an order on May 30th for a latex hybrid in talalay and still haven't heard a single word beyond the order confirmation and the fact that they took our money.  Are they usually this quiet and slow?
Memory foam topper or new mattress?. So i have a 20 year old mattress... That's been use around one month a year. It's super firm and a bit old. ??. Should i buy a memory foam topper maybe viscosoft or a new mattress maybe tuft and needle? Thanks
"How long does it take to get used to a new bed?. Been sleeping on my new mattress for a month and it feels terrible. Keep waking up after 5-6 hours every night with (middle) back pain and it just does not seem to get better.

The guy in the furniture store suggested to give it more time but the pain is killing me and it just feels unlikely that the comfortness would change that much over a few weeks."

"DIY mattress from shikibuton layers?. Basic problem: I move pretty often and seriously hate moving a mattress. I also hate that mattresses are super hard to recycle once they run out of life. 

I came up with a possible solution but would love advice on it. What if I got some shikibuton layers and stacked them, possibly with a memory foam topper? That way I could disassemble the mattress for moving or airing. If a layer wears out, it’s made of a single material so could be easily replaced and the used one repurposed — my partner sews, so we could turn cotton/wool batting into throw pillows, foam into floor pillows or dog beds, and compost (in municipal compost) any wool/cotton/latex components that are no longer usable. 


My details: mostly side sleeper, sometimes stomach, partner is mostly side, sometimes back.  Both of us are small to medium people — 5’4” but not skinny; I’m pregnant but it’s early yet. We’ve been sleeping on a Keetsa Tea Leaf Supreme and have been perfectly happy with it except that it’s wearing out after 8 years or so. This is a soft mattress made of a layer of their memory foam (“BioFoam”, def greenwashed) over a firmer foam core. 

My concerns: 

— no one where I live seems to sell these items in person (I’m in Colorado) so I can’t try stuff before buying, and the Futon Shop and Soaring Heart don’t have great return policies. Anyone know of online stores with better return policies? Anyone know a Colorado store with in person trials for shikibuton?

— Would a 3” memory foam topper on a 3” wool or cotton shiki be enough? Do I need an intermediate layer of latex? If so, is there a best place to buy it? How do I know how firm to go?

— Do layers slip without adhesive or tufting? Is a mattress cover enough to prevent that? (We’re considering moving up to a king if that’s relevant.)

— Would these go best on tatami mats, or would a slat situation be sufficient?

— I’ve been considering the Keetsa biofoam topper solely because I’ve been happy with our existing bed, but I’d welcome recs for a higher quality memory foam topper with a similar feel. It doesn’t have the sort of aggressive tempurpedic memory foam feel, and I think there’s a fiber topper that helps keep it from being super hot (though I can always get a wool pad for that). 

I read the FAQ and searched the sub for shiki and diy but still had a bunch of questions. Looking for info purely about shikibuton has led me mostly to folks who want to put the shiki away daily, which is not for us. I welcome pointers to existing resources/threads/posts and would be happy to modify anything that’s not within sub guidelines."
"Adjustable bed bases compatible with a platform bed frame?. Hi all,

Now that I'm back in the market for a bed, I want to actually get what I want: an adjustable bed base that can sit on top of a platform bed frame of my choosing. I have dark cherry finishes on all my furniture and I really miss having storage drawers under the bed so I don't want to give that up. To give you an idea, I'm going to want to purchase a storage bed kind of like this:  [https://www.getlaidbeds.com/wood-beds/low-bed-frames/japanese-fuji-platform-storage-bed?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Mb3BRCaARIsAPSNGpUvSzwuVPvgTHa1pQjELCkKaO4Crgj6Rl253nKFQ9GqOHZluNeMF6saAr2zEALw\_wcB](https://www.getlaidbeds.com/wood-beds/low-bed-frames/japanese-fuji-platform-storage-bed?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Mb3BRCaARIsAPSNGpUvSzwuVPvgTHa1pQjELCkKaO4Crgj6Rl253nKFQ9GqOHZluNeMF6saAr2zEALw_wcB)  or like this:  [https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/red-barrel-studio-treadwell-storage-platform-bed-rdba5904.html?piid=26127669](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/red-barrel-studio-treadwell-storage-platform-bed-rdba5904.html?piid=26127669). Please note that these were just the first 2 things that matched my google search for ""storage platform bed"" and I don't have any attachment/affiliation to either of the above examples (although they do look pretty so if you've bought one of them before and know that they suck in quality, let me know).

&#x200B;

I know some adjustable bed bases need to be standalone and others can be sat on top of platform beds but it's surprisingly hard to tell which can do what when looking at these online. Anyone have any (affordable) suggestions that will meet my needs?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"
"Would you buy a returned Casper mattress?. Someone on Facebook Marketplace is selling multiple California King-sized Casper mattresses at a very discounted price. I spoke with him and he said that they are mattresses that were returned within the 100-day trial window, so they have only been used for 3 months max. Buying a used mattress kind of gives me the ick thinking about it, but it's the only way I would be able to afford a Casper and will otherwise have to go with one of the much cheaper brands like Allswell or Cocoon. I'm mostly paranoid about bed bugs, but I know that foam isn't super habitable for them and they mostly go wild in things like box springs that have a lot of crevices. Do you all think if I gave it a good visual inspection and sanitized it as best as I could that I would most likely be okay? Thanks for any input!"
"Whelp, I finally got my Sleep Number delivered. A personal anecdote about electronic beds.. After trying out dozens of different beds in person, my partner and I finally found the absolute bed of our dreams: the i8. My partner and I are both medium weight mixed side/back sleepers and the adjustable base sounded like an amazing idea since I have heartburn and my partner snores. I took advantage of their Memorial Day sale along with my occupational discount and managed to get the bed and base just under $6k total. The sales rep in the store was super nice and knowledgeable so that helped as well. Huge amount of money, but I figured if you're spending a third of your life in bed, why not invest? The cost of getting the standalone remote for the bed was prohibitively expensive (I can't remember exactly but over $100 which was ridiculous) so I figured I'd just go with the option of using the free phone app to control it. Big whoop. 

Fast forward to yesterday evening: the bed gets delivered and the delivery guys ended stayed for 4 hours trying to get our phones to pair with the bed.

The technicians/movers couldn't figure out how to fix it, so they ended up leaving the bed there. I never signed any documents. Sleep number advertises that you have a worry-free 100 day trial but that doesn't include the adjustable base, which is a couple thousand dollars. This risk made me hesitant from the get go but it was so comfy that I said ""ah whatever""; as you can imagine, I was pretty freaked out at this point but I figured, we legitimately got a defective bed so they must take it back.

The next day, we call the store we bought it from for technical support. We got the same salesman on the phone that had originally sold us the bed and he did a 180 this time as soon as he heard the words ""replacement"" and ""Refund""--he was super rude and told us to call tech support without even giving us the phone number and hung up without another word. We ended up playing phone tag for hours and finally got to the regional manager, who was the most helpful person ever. He told us that we were a 1 in a million fluke and that everything that possibly could have gone wrong with us, went wrong. Apparently, the movers were supposed to take the bed out with them the minute they knew it was defective and they didn't. They also had a direct employee line to a tech support service which they didn't call. To boot, the salesman at the store has lied to us about several features of the bed: in the store, he said it would function off of bluetooth only--this was a lie: turns out, it needs to be connected to wifi at all times. 

We asked the salesman about whether or not we'd get stuck folded like a taco in whatever position the bed left off in if there's a power outage. He told us not to worry, that if the power were to ever go out, we'd be fine since it comes with a battery that would hold its position.  This was also a lie. 

We finally got a resolution thanks to the regional manager: at this point our only options were to have them send someone to replace the pump, which would void our ability to return anything, or to return \*everything\*, even the bed. There was no option to send us a replacement. So with this all-or-nothing decision, I had to make the difficult decision to return it, which sucked because I genuinely \*really\* liked the bed. There was no option to ""repurchase"" with my discount and I found this kind of shady from a company policy perspective. In the meantime, I'm stuck with the bed and have been sleeping on it for 2 days now. While mega comfy, even that experience hasn't been perfect since it keeps resetting to the ""auto"" level of air filling which is 50/100 (much more firm than I wanted it to be).

TL;DR lessons/takeaways I've had from this experience (including stuff I didn't mention above):

\-You can love a bed all you want but if the company dealing it has shady/convoluted/bizarre loopholes to their return policies OR makes you commit to a nonrefundable portion of purchase, it's not worth the headache.

\-Do not trust anything a salesman tells you and make sure to independently verify it. We didn't bother because we were lazy tbh.

\-If you're trying any sort of bed, especially an electric bed, make sure to try adjusting it while you're laying on your back AND side. When I was on my back, the sound of the pump working was basically nonexistent. When I was lying on my side however, the sound transmitted loudly through the bed and pillow I was sleeping on (it was just a regular memory foam pillow if that helps). I'm honestly kind of grateful for the factory defect because if it weren't for dumb luck, I would have been stuck with this loud-ass base which definitely would have woken me up if I rolled onto my side at night.

\-When considering buying any sort of bed that plugs into a wall, make sure you're prepared for a lot more random stuff to go wrong. Adding electricity and pumps and bluetooth and whatnot into the mix means that suddenly, you have to actually consider hypothetical scenarios of ""how am I going to sleep in my bed if the power goes out""? Honestly, I loved the feel of this bed but after really getting to experience everything go wrong up front, I realize that the hassle of dealing with an electric bed is probably not for me.

&#x200B;

So... off I go, back in the hustle of trying to find a mattress. Hope this helped someone out there. 

(While I'm here, if anyone has any recommendations for adjustable bed bases that can sit on top of platforms or has any recommendation for a bed that is halfway between bouncy and avoiding motion transfer, hit me up. I am tired.)"

"Mattress Recommendations for Stomach Sleeper. Hi r/mattress,

I’m looking for something to replace my current mattress. A dip has formed and I feel like I’m spending the entire night tossing and turning trying to get comfortable, but I just can’t. 

I’m starting to look for a new mattress, one that will last a solid couple of years! I’m 5’7 and 145 pounds, and sleep on my stomach. Occasionally I will sleep with one leg at a 90° angle, with my knee at about belly button level. It’s like half on my stomach, half on my side. I know that sleeping on your stomach is not the best position long term, but I’ve tried to break the habit and haven’t been able to, so just work with me here!! 

I definitely prefer mattresses on the more firm side. I tried out a couple at mattress firm and loved the Beautyrest Hybrid BRX1000-IP Medium. It felt amazing in any position I tried, and the cooling top was perfect as I’m a hot sleeper. Some reviews say that owners are experiencing dips or sinking after a few months to a year and that’s what worries me, especially for the price. 

I’m hoping this sub can help me out with some recommendations on mattresses I can do more research on! This is going to be a major purchase for me, so I want to make sure I get it right. Thanks, y’all!"

"Alternatives to Tempurpedic ProAdapt Firm in Honolulu, Hawaii?. Hello,  


I've been doing a lot of research and found that my favorite mattress is the Tempurpedic ProAdapt firm, second favorite being a combination Latex mattress I tried called the Aireloom Cardiff firm, however, there would be too much transference of movement on the mattress ( when my partner/cat moves ).  


I am looking for a Queen or King size mattress in Honolulu, Hawaii. There are no local manufacturers who produce this type of mattress so I am wondering if I should just purchase it from Slumberworld Hawaii. It would come with a 3 month return policy and 2 year mattress upgrade ( if I purchase a waterproof cover ). However, the price would be $3,299 ( Queen ) and $3,999 ( King ) from Slumberworld ( $1,000 over the Tempurpedic advertised price online ) [www.tempurpedic.com/shop-mattresses/tempur-proadapt/v/2618/](https://www.tempurpedic.com/shop-mattresses/tempur-proadapt/v/2618/)  


According to another post I've seen, the comfort layer was only 1.6lbs density for this mattress, however, in the showroom I felt perfectly aligned and comfortable. I was wondering if there were any other alternatives that I am overlooking?  


I considered going the DIY route, however, I am worried that I would not be satisfied with my choices and it would take me several tries to get the perfect match that would come out to a similar price to the Tempurpedic after shipping costs to Hawaii."
"Did we get a good deal on a Purple mattress & MF 600 adjustable base at Mattress Firm?. My boyfriend and I want to upgrade our crappy, non-branded memory foam queen mattress for a nicer king size that we will be able to sleep comfortably on for the next few years.  We both prefer a softer bed and would like to stick with the memory foam feel (for reference, I’m 5’7 about 110 lbs and he is 5’8 190 lbs) After seeing a ton of videos and reviews, we were leaning more towards the Layla mattress but interested in trying out the Purple.

We decided to go to a Mattress Firm down the street to test out different options and ended up really liking the Purple Hybrid Premier mattresses (3 and 4). The sales associate found one Purple 3 available that had been returned and was on clearance for $1199. I am normally the type of person to fully research anything and everything before spending money and was iffy about buying a pre-owned mattress, but it seemed like too good of a deal to pass on considering the mattress is normally $2699. 

We decided to go for it and add on the Mattress Firm 600 adjustable base for an additional $799. Altogether, we were able to finance the total $2123 with 0 interest over 24 months. 

While I do feel like we got a good deal, I am really nervous about it being final sale. I was up all night fully researching both the mattress and base and the reviews are so mixed it’s hard not to second guess if we made a good decision. 

We were thinking about cancelling the order and just buying the mattress new so that we can test it out and still be able to return it, but if we decided that we liked it I’m not sure we would be able to return it and find another one at the $1199 price again- and buying, returning, and re-buying seems like a headache that i’m not sure I want to deal with either. 

I guess what I’m asking is, did we get a really good deal for a good quality mattress/base that will last? Or should we cancel the order and keep looking at other options? Any input on ANYTHING related to my situation would be appreciated because I don’t want to stress myself out over a mattress any longer lol."
"So many choices that I can't decide. Hello my fellow Redditors,

So I'm in a situation right now where I want to buy a new mattress....aaaand I'm looking at a couple of options. It's important I note that I reside in Ontario Canada so I would like some Canadian help orrr for the multinational brands, everyone is welcome.

Having said that, I am looking at The Douglas and Endy as top two contenders atm, and ESPECIALLY Endy rn because they are offering a supposed $200 weighted blanket for free. So what I would like from this is feedback on these products from those who've used them, and those who are experts in the industry and know the field very well. Are they worth the $1000 price tag? Is the Endy promo a good promo or should I wait a bit longer for something better? Is there a better promo? So far between both Endy and Douglass, this is the best promo I've seen.

Are foam mattresses the way to go? Is there a better product you can purchase for around the same price? I like the warranty and 100 night reassurance trial of both brands. I had previously considered the Sealy posturepedic mattresses from Costco as they are extremely well priced and Costco allows you to basically exchange or return once every 2 years. Should I go for something like that? 

I want to get something nice for the wife and I and I am a bit torn so please help. I do like the appeal of an all foam because there are no moving parts which means no noise making when love making lol.

"Accidentally released “glass fiber” into apartment by opening Zinus mattress cover. UPDATE:

I just chatted with an incredibly helpful and forthright company rep who said the mattress is wrapped in delicate fiberglass cloth, and unless the outer cover is gently removed the fiberglass cloth will rip and shed fiberglass. She confirmed this is indeed fiberglass, not something different as a previous employee tried to tell me.

She also said they have received no reports of people getting sick from this, just lots of itching. Said I could clean this up myself and there’s no need to evacuate and call in a professional.
—————-

Accidentally released “glass fiber” into apartment by opening Zinus mattress cover

So I’ve had a Zinus Green Tea mattress since 2017, and recently we have been feeling/seeing what we thought were bug bites. After inspecting the cover and seeing no signs of bugs or shells, I noticed the cover has a zipper underneath. 

So I thought “let’s look whether there are bugs inside.” By the time I fully unzipped I then decided “let’s wash this thing just in case there are some unseen bugs trapped inside.” Huge mistake.

Turns out the inside of the cover was absolutely loaded with “glass fiber”, had no clue and there was no clear warning not to unzip. Turns out the company has a small “do not remove” tag hidden behind the main mattress cover tag, but even that tag doesn’t warn you’re about to explode little plastic threads all over your apartment.

So now, these things are fucking everywhere. The company tells me “they are not hazardous they can only be skin irritant but that will be gone,” and “you can turn off your light and use your flashlight to see the glass fibers and clean it with your vacuum.”

So far, I’ve covered the mattress in cut up trash bags and duct tape (Home Depot out of stock of mattress disposal bags), ordered a new mattress which won’t get here until Friday, and run my Roomba multiple times.

Is there anything else I can/should be doing? Also, does anyone know whether these things are indeed “not hazardous?”

What makes me most mad about this is that the pinching/biting feelings that initially caused me to search for bugs were this mattress shedding its “glass fibers,” but Zinus says this is all my fault. Also, found there’s a class action lawsuit against the company for this exact situation, too bad I found that out after releasing this plague upon myself.

TL:DR - released “glass fiber” from Zinus mattress all over my apartment. Company tells me fibers are not hazardous, but are irritating skin. Getting new mattress Friday. What else could/should I be doing? Also, how worried should I be for my health?

If you’re interested, here are details I found on the class action suit. There’s also a link to a news story in here which shows a family dealing with the same situation: https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/household/zinus-class-action-says-mattress-leaked-glass-fibers/"
"(Natural) Latex mattresses with the best return policy and stats. Hi all,

After a failed trial of Sleep Number, I'm looking to try a latex bed. There are a ton of sellers of Latex beds and while a lot of the return policies look good at first glance, I know some companies go out of their way to be tricky about returns.

In your experience, who has the most hassle/risk-free return policy?

Also, in general, what combination of latex is generally nice? I see everything ranging from 6"" to 12"" with various amounts of comfort layers (some of which are also apparently latex, which is even more confusing) and as someone going into this new market blind, I'm kind of at a loss. My partner and I are both side/back sleepers, 5'4""-5'8"", 160-190lbs if that helps."
"I give up?. Ugh I’ve tried so many beds Over the last 2 years. And haven’t found. The right one. But I’ve learned a lot what I like and don’t like. And want and don’t want ;) 

I’m a side sleeper (female) 5”3– 138 lbs 
I’m very active. But also have bad low back issues- 

Every bed has made me soooo stiff . Super Sore sides.  Or sore back/neck or lack of pressure relief or something. Lol 

I’ve tried:

Casper 
Casper wave 
T&N mint 
Brooklyn bedding aurora
Brentwood home Oceano
Wink bed
Saavta
Bear hybrid 
Icomfort Serta cf4000 plush 
Nest Alexandra hybrid
Puffy royal 

Right now I’m on the Serta icomfort cf3000 medium. Ehhh kinda firm 

I want a good good quality bed. 12-14 inches high 
Preferably memory form.  I like to sink in some. I like a medium. - medium soft.  I like more natural ones if possible. (Non toxic ) budget is 3500$. Help! What shuld I do next ? Lol I’m sick of this process and want it to end. I have the perfect bedding. And set up. It’s comfy now I want the perfect mattress for me."
"Sleepy's Gel Matrix Hybrid vs. Purple 2 Hybrid. I was thinking about getting Purple 2 because the polymer grid seems to be great for cooling and weight distribution. Recently, I also found [Sleepy's mattress](https://www.mattressfirm.com/sleepys/12-inch-gel-matrix-hybrid-mattress/mfi136917.html#q=sleepys%2Bhybrid&lang=default&start=1) on Mattress Firm with the Gel Matrix, which looks like the polymer grid from Purple but it does not have any reviews. I do not know which of the two would be better for me. Does anyone have experience with Sleepy's Gel Matrix? Would you recommend Sleepy's or Purple?"
"Can I negotiate for Mattress Firm to take back a non-refundable mattress? SOS!!. A few weeks ago, I found myself needing a mattress ASAP, so I bought a new one. I was immediately drawn to one mattress, and after some deliberation, I decided to buy it. Since it was on the floor, the salesman told me it would be non-refundable. (The only reason I agreed to this was because the mattress was being discontinued, and it was the only way I could get one.)

Fast forward to now and I absolutely loath this mattress. Not to be dramatic, but it feels way too firm (I remember it feeling soft in the store idk??). I also didn't notice how thick it was and I'm worried it'll look awkward when I move into my new house in a few weeks (my room is really small and its about 14 inches tall, maybe taller). Basically, it was like I had a honey moon period with my mattress and it's over now.

I'm wondering if there's any hope in going to Mattress Firm and basically begging them to take it back? It was 1.5k (originally 3k), but I'm willing to lose some money and exchange it for a much cheaper mattress.

Maybe this is stupid but I feel like I got along really well with the salesman! I get it's their job to get along with people lol but maybe it could work in my favor?"
"Can’t get this ink stain out of the mattress. I’ve tried everything. I’ve brought baking soda and white vinegar, oxyclean, and hydrogen peroxide.

"Avocado pillow top + topper?. Wife and I are one month into our ownership of an avocado green with pillow top and still find it too firm for our taste.  My question is whether or not it is wise to add a sleeponlatex 2 or 3 inch soft topper on top of what we have.  I assume it would be softer but are there diminishing returns the more layers you add?  Would support be hurt by this?  

Any input from any of you who have been down this road would be much appreciated!"
"Nectar pillows seem flat and flimsy?. I just got my Nectar mattress a few days ago. It’s my second night sleeping on it.

No complaints, except that the two pillows it came with do not seem very fluffy at all. I let everything air out for a little over 24 hours, and the pillows just seem flatter than they should be, and kinda flimsy? I was expecting a nice fluffy memory foam feel.

Is it possible they’re defective? I’ve tried fluffing them around by hand but nothing seems to change it much. For pillows that retail at $75, I’d be extremely pissed if they’re supposed to be this flimsy. Almost like the shredded foam inside is either too weak or there’s not enough."
Giving up on the foam mattress. I recently bought a home and have had an IKEA foam mattress and bed frame with the wooden slates forever and I am ready to get a regular bed not foam mattress. My question is- can I buy a mattress and still use my bed frame? I didn’t know if all queen frames and mattresses had a universal size. Thank you!
Has anyone had any experience with a Sealy performance Kelburn II. Saw it in the store today and my wife really liked it but I havent found many reviews. Any info would help.
"Arizona Premium vs SleepEZ. Alright, I've decided to spend a good chunk more on a mattress and get one that I actually expect to last me 10-15 years.

I have narrowed it down to Arizona Premium or SleepEZ.

 SleepEZ is cheaper for the same mattress and comes with a free latex pillow which seems to be actually worth around $50.

Arizona Premium appears to have a better return policy(pay return shipping vs $100 flat rate at SleepEZ.) and I've seen more positive reviews for APM overall. Not that I've seen any real negatives for SleepEZ. 

If I go with SleepEZ, any opinions on Roma vs Hybrid for $100 difference? 

Thanks!!"
"Restonic Blissful Plush -- Help!. We purchased a Restonic Blissful Plush mattress last month and have tried living with it for the last 19 days.  It runs hot!  We added a ""cooling"" protective cover, which helped, but it still runs warm-hot, which isn't blissful at all.

Waiting for a call back from the seller (big box store) today, but I'm 99% pretty sure they're not going to refund my money, offer up an exchange, etc...

I don't really want to take a $800 loss on this and buy another mattress -- are there any options that would help?  Worst case scenario -- better mattresses in the $800-1000 range for hot sleepers?

Update: They won't take a return, so I won't be shopping with Furniture Mart in the future."
"Comfort Option mattresses. There seems to be a lot of hype but mystery around Comfort Option bedding and was wondering if I could get some insight. I see this brands name thrown around alot as having customizable options and using high quality foams.

I read through their foam densities and saw they do indeed use high quality/density foams in their base layers but it seems their upper comfort layers use below average density foams, my thoughts were confirmed about their densities on themattressunderground.

My question is why has this brand been brought up so much lately and what makes it so good? Why haven't the lower density comfort layers been mentioned? Has anyone had any personal experiences with this mattress? How does it feel, how long has it lasted? Are there any mattresses or configurations one should avoid?

I don't post this looking to besmirch Comfort Option but rather as a potential buyer."
What do you guys think about the Purple mattress 3?. Went to mattress firm this week and really liked it. Might pull the trigger on it..
"I need advice on a new mattress.... Hello mattress gurus:

I recently replaced a 10 year-old IKEA Sultan Fossing that I paid $400 for.  I think it was a latex foam mattress.  Never gave me any issues until this year.  Pinched a nerve pretty bad and pulled the trigger on a Layla original, the flippable one, figuring that would give me more options (something I appreciate when buying a mattress I haven't tried first).

It's been two weeks now, and my lower back is still killing me.  The nerve pain is gone, but there's a terrible stiffness I have every morning.  I'm a side sleeper, who tends to change position quite frequently throughout the night.  I've never had a memory foam mattress, but I'm wondering if that ""sink in"" feeling is preventing me from easily changing positions and causing me stiffness and pain.

I definitely think I'll be returning the Layla.  I've tried both sides to no avail.  I'm just not sure what the solution here is.  I've slept on $100-$400 mattresses my entire life without a problem, so I assumed something in the $850 range like the Layla would be leaps and bounds ahead of anything I've ever slept on.  But maybe memory foam just isn't right for me.

What do I need here?  Something more responsive?  Thinking about the Purple original, since I also sleep quite hot.  Reviews say it's more responsive than memory foam, which might be what I need.

Or maybe spring for a hybrid?  Go get a traditional coil mattress?

Or just go get another IKEA latex/foam one, since I slept on one of those for a decade without problems?

Trying mattresses in stores never works for me.  I think everything's comfortable for 5-60 minutes.  It's only after sleeping on something for 8+ hours that problems become apparent.

EDIT:  Looks like IKEA mattresses have gone downhill lately.  Anyone recommend some other latex options?  Sleep on Latex has some good reviewed stuff.  Really think latex is the right play for side sleepers who need to move a lot."
"6"" Latex mattress( with 2"" topper) or 7"" latex-only?. I have the option of getting 6"" 100% latex dunlop mattress or a 7"" one.  According to the sales guy, these would actually be 5""/6"" of latex respectively, rest is cotton cover. Both are priced relatively the same. I'm saving about $100 on the 6"" one.

I've read that latex-only tend to be too hard, so I thought buying a 6"" mattress and using the $100 saved on a memory foam topper would be wiser. 

Any ideas on what would be better? Would the 7"" make it much more durable?"
"Requesting Advice for New Mattress & Pillows. My knowledge of proper bedding that would fit my sleeping style doesn't exist. I produce entirely too much body heat and tend to switch positions 10-20 times per night because of it. I have 0 ideas about which type of mattress or pillows to search for in terms of materials that are both extremely comfortable and also reduce heat as much as possible. The only thing im certain of is that with the amount of tossing and turning i do, a queen size is the best fit. 

Recommendations on both mattresses and pillows would be very much appreciated <3"
"Mattress pad hunt, or maybe just new bed?. I have a full-size bed that I'm considering replacing because it seems firmer than it used to be, and maybe sinking a little in the middle. The sinking is really only noticeable if two people sleep on it, and we usually sleep on it one at a time. It's a double-sided mattress, mostly used for guests, but my husband and I occasionally take turns sleeping on it to give each other alone time on our nice queen bed. We've had that full bed for 3 or 4 years. I flip the full mattress over sometimes, hoping to preserve whatever softness is left. It's nowhere near as comfortable as our queen, which we have had for 6 years. My husband can no longer tolerate sleeping on the full bed, but I still can on occasion. It was supposed to be a good brand, but we got it from a mattress outlet place and it might be a dud.

I've been looking for a cushier mattress pad that will help negate the firmness of the full bed without making it super hot. It would be nice not to spend the money on a new bed right now if we can avoid it. I'm not entirely sure if the mattress is worth keeping. Also, mattress pads on Amazon are strangely more expensive for full beds than queen beds. What's with that? Are full beds less common now? Should I give up and get a new mattress? Does that mean I should replace the box spring, too?"
"Nectar Mattress Scam - Deleting negative feedback on all social media. Seems like many have experienced this as well... curious to see what your outcomes were. 

My wife and I ordered a king mattress with the “399” in accessories about 3 weeks ago. Just got the mattress protector and sheets and they are NOTHING like what is pictured online. It honestly looks like they went to Ross or TJ maxx and purchased all their stuff to send with orders. This stuff is maybe worth ~$50 tops. The sheets are beige, not even white...

Just got the bed today and based on this don’t even want to open it. I don’t trust them @ all with this experience with the other items and would like to return. Of course all of their website “free returns” “no worries” claims etc plastered all over their website. I’ve been reading that others are getting refunds minus the value of these accessories. I went I back through the order process and you can’t even buy the bed without the pillows... I don’t know how that would be legal to MAKE you purchase something and then not give you a full refund for it. 

Been waiting in the chat.. my number in line has gone down to 10, then actually INCREASED to 15. Feels like they are playing games with trying to talk to someone. My wife left negative comments on FB and they were deleted 15 minutes later.

"Any advice on a cool mattress from Mattress firm? Warranty credit - How to maximize?. Yeah, I know, MF isn't exactly highly recommended.

I've had *really* bad luck the past few purchases.  Have bought Tempur, sleepnumber, and then the Beautyrest (probably too firm), all causing back pain or overheating issues, especially for any of the foam or bed-in-box mattress I've bought.

"Memory Foam after a year?. I bought a Douglas memory foam mattress about 15 months ago. All of a sudden around March, my lower back started hurting in bed. It was so bad, I would go on the sofa to sleep - which is actually less firm - my partner was experience the exact same thing. The bed frame is metal, and very sturdy, and there were no obvious impressions in the mattress. I feel like the memory foam simply lost its firmness. 

I have since returned the Douglas - but it was very comfortable in the beginning. Does this mean the memory foam in these non-latex Endy/Douglas beds lose quality very quickly?

"Mattress in a Box weight - how hard would it be to carry one around?. I'm looking to buy a mattress in a box for moving into an unfurnished apartment. My thoughts are that if I have them delivered to my current residence, I don't need to schedule a day for when I need to wait at the new residence all day on the hardwood floor, I can just get the mattress, carry it to the new place, then set it up there.

Issue is, I'm not sure if it'll be too heavy to carry onto the skytrain and off. A cursory look says that the final weight would be 80-90 lb. I'm around twice that, but I'm not exactly sure how much I can lift, and how I'd be when lifting a box like that since shape matters.

So my question is, do you think it's a good idea to order the mattress, then to carry it on public transit? Or will it be too heavy?"
"400 vs 800 thread count Percale sheets (Italian long stem Egyptian cotton) for tropics?. I found someone selling sheets made by an old Italian business, and they weave 400 and 800 thread count Percale sheets (plus satin up to 1,000 thread count), with real Italian long stem Egyptian cotton. I was thinking of the 400 thread count Percale for a room in the tropics (not for the winter in a mountain region of Italy). They told me the 800 thread count is much softer to sleep in and should not be noticeably warmer than the 400. They also said they had buyers from hotter parts of Asia who enjoyed the 800 thread count.

Does this make sense? I would have thought that the 800 thread count is necessarily much denser, but I don't know if it's still cool because of the percale weave (as opposed to satin).

800 thread count percale is not typical but has anyone here actually tried it (as opposed to 800 or 1,000 thread count real satin sheets)?

"Nectar nightmare. Recently I started shopping for a new mattress. I landed on Nectar as I read some good reviews online about them. I also watched a few YouTube videos where they were highly recommended. Then came the bad part. Actually receiving the mattress. They took my money immediately, however the next day sent an email saying that my shipment would be delayed giving no time frame. Contacting customer service was nearly impossible. And when I did they were unable to provide any specifics about delivery dates. I then canceled the order. I was told it would take a few days for the order to be canceled. 2 days after I canceled the order here comes a tracking number from Nectar! At this point I had already purchased a mattress in store (Sealy Hybrid Silver Chill King). After a spending almost a full day on chat trying to resolve this I finally got a refund. For anyone considering a nectar mattress I would encourage you to go look at their Twitter account (I wished I had). It is full of nothing but complaints and problems with this company. My advice is to stay far far away from nectar mattresses."
"With Covid closures, should I just purple and be done with it?. My wife and I have had decent mattresses from Denver Mattress for about 10 years, but it's probably time to look at something else. Because we got floor models, we didn't worry about getting ripped off and got a decent deal. With more disposable income now (and getting older), I'm 100% on board with paying a fair sum as long as it's WORTH IT. 

I've heard various things about Purples and really don't care about brand name as long as we can get something comfortable that will last a decade or damn near. The hard part is that with all the stores closed, we can't even lie down on one and probably won't be able to for quite some time. 

Is it worth giving Purple a try? In theory they have free delivery, trial period, and pickup if it doesn't work out (or is that easier said than done/scammy?)."
"Need help deciding on latex mattress. Me: 5’4, 150-ish lbs. 45 yo. **Fibromyalgia/neck/hip pain issues. Mostly side sleeper but wake up on my back.** Very heavy sleeper but toss and turn A LOT.

Husband: 5’9, 155-ish lbs. 46 yo. Athlete with **history of sciatica. Side/back sleeper**. Very very light sleeper (wakes up repeatedly during the night).

We have an old box spring king size mattress on top of a slatted base. Two years ago we knew it was time to start looking for a new mattress so I came here and scoured online sites for info. It was overwhelming and because of my chronic pain issues I was really nervous about making the wrong decision and having to return a huge ass mattress, not to mention a long break in period where I could potentially have an increase in pain. So, in an effort to bide time I bought a **3” soft SOL topper.** I had trouble finding a pillow that didn’t kill my neck but I eventually did, although recently I’ve been waking up with a stiff neck. The SOL topper definitely helped but the mattress is now even in worse condition so back to the drawing board. 

I’ve been mostly looking at latex. I *think* I narrowed it down to **SOL** and **SleepEZ**. 
The SOL reviews that it’s EXTREMELY firm scare me but perhaps our topper would remedy that? Can anyone comment on that? That said, their customer service and return policy sound like a real plus. On the other hand, I like that SleepEZ has a variety of configurations but the fact that there are all these separate pieces is concerning. Will we be able to hoist it/them up our flight of stairs? Which configuration would be best for our specific needs, considering we will be putting the topper over it?

There’s a fancy organic mattress store near me that doesn’t carry either of these brands but they do carry latex. I emailed to see if I can get an appointment to come in (Covid rules) and am waiting to hear back. Of course, lying on a showroom bed for a little while won’t tell me how 8hrs night after night will be but at least it’s something. 

Thanks for making it this far reading! If anyone has any thoughts, advice or comments I’d love to hear them."
"T&N Mint vs Brentwood Latex Hybrid. Hi all,

I am looking to buy a new queen mattress and because fo COVID and limiting myself to Bed-in-a-Box models.  I have never bought a new mattress before and have always used hand-me-down, old, mattresses so anything I buy will be a huge improvement, but I want to make a well informed decision.

I am 5'9"" and \~160 lbs and am both a side and back sleeper (primarily side but change positions throughout the night).

From what i've seen a lot of the all foam mattresses are pretty similar, but I have been looking at T&N Mint because it seems to be softer than some others and that is more what I am used to.  I am also looking at the Brentwood Latex Hybrid ([https://www.brentwoodhome.com/products/hybrid-latex-mattress?variant=31877131763774](https://www.brentwoodhome.com/products/hybrid-latex-mattress?variant=31877131763774)) because i've heard good things about hybrid and latex models and it falls within my price range.

T&N Mint offers a 100 day trials and the Brentwood offers a 365 day trial.  Based on my height/weight and sleeping habits anyone have an educated guess on which would be a better bed to have as my first option?  Also open to other recommendations based on the info I have given (Looking to spend no more than \~$1200 on a mattress as I will also be buying a new foundation)."

"Immediate indentation within 24 hours of Sealy mattress delivery, what should I do?. Background is that I’ve previously only had hand me down mattresses from parents or a friend. I’m a side sleeper and with all the mattresses I’ve ever received (even the one from a friend that was firm and basically brand new because it was too firm for her) I have “dented” the bed in less than 3 months after sleeping in it (hip area on the bed). So, earlier this month, I was finally getting a new bed. I liked the Stearns & Foster Hurston a lot, but read reviews that people said it started to sag within 3 months. So, kept searching and then found the Sealy Chestnut Street Cushion firm mattress. Laid on it and didn’t feel like I was falling in and it felt firm, so decided to get that. Fast forward to delivery on Friday. Got it around 10 am and decided to take a nap on it after putting the mattress protector on it. Felt fine and then when I came back to it last night, sat up and watched some tv and then laid down and went to sleep. Woke up, and about 20 minutes later, noticed an indentation in the sheets. Thought it was just the sheets and left for the day. Came back around 4 pm and went to check, pulled  up the mattress protector and noticed the indentation. Took measuring tape and placed the edge of it along the edges of the bed and in the area where I slept, there was a dip. Also, on that side, the edge of the bed isn’t straight down, the pillow top does not go to the edge and the actual start for the frame of the mattress bulges out. I’m not a “big” person by any means, so when I received my courtesy call from the associate who sold me the mattress, I explained what happened. They called customer service for me and they set up an appt for a technician to come out, but here’s the confusing part. Since it hasn’t been 24 hours, theres an indentation but not 1.5 inches (as listed in the warranty), so should I return the bed since I’m in the 120 day window and go for a different one, or will the frame fall under the manufacturer defect since the associate specifically brought up the 1.5 inches part? I currently flipped the mattress around to see if the other side would do the same thing. Any thoughts/recommendations on a potential replacement would be great!"

I am 5'10'' and around 150 lb, I am a side sleeper who tends to sleep on the hotter side, and I prefer a medium-firm mattress.

\- Alexander Nest Signature hybrid, medium

\- Helix midnight

\- Sealy hybrid Kelburn II

\- Brooklyn Bedding, medium

\- Wink, luxury firm

\-Luma Sleep Hybrid Slumber System - $1870

Coils and latex hybrid

&#x200B;

\-Avocado Green -$1800

Highly rated innerspring on Consumer reports.  Probably would add a topper since it is supposed to be firmer

&#x200B;

\-Ghost Bed Luxe - $1534

Seems like a good value for what you get.  Rated well on Mattress Underground

&#x200B;

\-Tempur-pedic - $2500+

Not really settled on which I would choose... most internet resources including consumer reports don't rate this particularly well, but conventional wisdom says this is a reliable choice.  What's the scoop here?  There is a sale supposedly starting on 6/21

Thanks for any input!

"Mattress in a box, questions. Hi guys, 

So I'm looking to get a new mattress and some of my top contenders are Purple, Tuft and Needle, & Puffy. Was wondering if any of you guys have them or have used them and if you can give a small review about them? Also, the ones that have but did not like them how was the return process? I've heard a lot of about how they're not good/easy to process, or they wont give you a full refund because of the 'free gifts'. 

Thank you for the time to answer if you do!"
"Intellibed Midnight- a good choice? Or Tempur?. Ok, friends and lurkers, it’s me. The gal who got a Wellsville Carbon Cool. It’s getting better, but my husband’s arms keep going numb on it. I still feel like it’s a quality product, but it may not be the quality product for us. 

So, we’re back to the drawing board. 

I tested out an Intellibed Midnight today and the ProAdapt Hybrid Medium as well. I liked both a lot. I need more firm, and he likes plush. 

I love Tempur, but he remembers our old brown brick Tempur that was hot as hades. They ALL seem cooler than that now. I was planning to look at the Lux Breeze , but when I laid on it at MF (hiss hiss, small town), the salesman said, “Not gonna lie, your face went all relaxed on the ProAdapt.” (FWIW, I asked what they sleep on and one has a Dreambed- she said they used to sell it- and the other had just ordered the  Silver Chill and was giddy about it. He’d saved; his family doesn’t like financing. I get it.)

I’m hella cheap, so the $ on the Intellibed makes me feel like I’m not being intelligent with my money (or my comedy, sorry). That said, I’m over the hill with some pretty back back and neck issues, and my husband can’t really work if his arms are numb. I worry about the comfort layer sagging, which happened with the Beautyrest we got after the Brown Tempur Brick. (I miss you, friend...)

And yes, I know there are some strong feelings about MF here, but I have zero problem working with nice people on a quality product. I just want to be sure I’m looking at quality products."

"This can't be right, can it? $175 king air mattress + $370 TempurPedic topper = amazing?. We're in an apartment temporarily after selling our house and moving cross country, now waiting to close on a new house. Our King mattress was about 12 years old and had developed deep body impressions years ago, and was simply painful. So we left it behind.

In the interim, in the apartment for a few months, we decided we could just live with a nice King air mattress (Sound Asleep Dream series) for $175, and we splurged and purchased a 3"" Tempur-Pedic memory foam topper. Using our regular sheets etc. This was just to get us by until we get into the new house and purchase a new mattress (Likely a Tempurpedic Proadapt medium, not the hybrid.)

Soooooo  - we noticed that fully pumped up, with the topper, this mattress is a LOT more comfortable that our old mattress we paid $2000 for 12 years ago. OK, that bed was worn out. However, we are finding this bed to be extremely comfortable, and we both have back issues. If there is any hint of support loss, we turn the switch and pump it fully up and it feels like a new bed.

We went yesterday and we laid down on the Tempurpedic Pro-adapt Medium, and we really liked it. When we got home and went to bed, we asked each other - is that bed really $3300 better than this one? 

We usually spend months lying on beds before we purchase, so we're picky. We're both on the older end of the age range, in the 150 - 170 weight range, bad backs. But we're wondering why spend all the money on a high end new mattress when this one feels so nice? And we feel like we MUST be missing something!"
"Opinions on Tuft and Needle Mint Bed, and do I need a box spring or a bed frame?. I’m buying a new mattress, and eying the [Tuft & Needle Mint ](https://www.tuftandneedle.com/mattress/mint/) because I think it would be a reasonably priced mattress for what I’m mostly looking for: soft-to-medium firmness, good for a side sleeper, and doesn’t overheat (supposedly). I checked SleepLikeTheDead and Sleep Foundation’s reviews. 

It’s supposed to mostly be made of the producing company’s foam substance. Has anyone here used or tried one of these mattresses? 

My second question is: would it be better to use a box frame or a wooden bed frame with this bed? I currently have a box frame, but it’s as old as the mattress I’m currently on, if not older, and I’m not sure if it should be replaced, too.

Thank you for your time and patience. This is my first time buying a bed on my own; I have slept for the last 12 years on a spring frame my parents gave me on top of a box frame. The mattress is finally crapping out and I’m trying to shop responsibly."
"Purple Pillows Super Hard?. My husband and I invested in the basic purple Pillows, and we've not been happy with them.

We both wake up with our ears, cheeks, etc hurting from the pillow. I also find that it gets crazy hot. So hot I can barely touch it and have to wait before I can go back to sleep when it wakes me up.

Originally the purple mattress had been our dream bed, but now we are reconsidering. If my ear can hurt from the pillow, wouldn't my hips and shoulders hurt from the mattress? 

Has anyone else had this experience? Is the purple mattress actually super hard on your pressure points? And is it super hot?"
"TempurPro vs TempurLux vs Purple Hybrid Premier vs ???. I'm currently sleeping on a mattress that's probably 20 years old. I've never had a nice mattress before, and I'm fully in the school of ""buy once, cry once"". The only thing I remember from the last time I heard anything about mattresses is that you should replace them every 7 years (is that still a thing btw?)

Anyhow, I'm primarily a stomach and side sleeper, and I weigh 150lbs. There's about 2385738473 different mattress ads on my instagram feed now because big brother knows I'm in the market. From reading things on this sub, I see tempurpedic suggested a lot, and then I read a lot about all these newer companies like Nectar and Casper and Tuft and Needle etc etc.

I honestly just want the most bang for my buck in terms of comfort and longevity. I understand that comfort is highly subjective, so I guess it's pointless for me to ask for opinions in that department, but I was wondering if anyone has had experience with with the TempurPro, TempurLux, or the Purple Hybrid premier.

If anyone has and reasons to go, or not go, for any of those - I'd be interested in your opinions. I'm not heart set on any of those, so I'm open to other suggestions. I'm in the US if that matters."

"Opinion for Sealy performance plus hybrid mattress. Hi all

Best Buy currently is offering a huge discount on a hybrid sealy mattress. After doing some research, it seems to me that the memory foam topper is of low quality (2.5 lb/csf). It is also seems to be filled with worse quality foam in the middle follows by coils at the bottom. The product line looks to be discontinued which is why I’m guessing there is a discount on it. The other con is that I won’t be try it out in store as it’s only available online. Could anyone please share your opinion?


The other alternative I’m looking at is a tempurpedic support 2.0 which is on sale at the brick. But the price is more than double. It also seems to be an older product line.

"Tired of lower back pain, finally ready to invest in a good mattress, but I don’t want to get scammed. It’s time for a new bed, and this time I don’t want to mess around. I’m tired of lower back pain and waking up tired. I’m ready to spend some real money, but I don’t want to even deal with the mattress store scammers.

I’ve been reading the posts and FAQs here and there’s way more to research than I have the stomach for. I found a bed frame I like at Restoration Hardware, so I think I’m good there. Now for the mattress.

I think what I’m looking for is a medium hybrid king. I like a softer bed and my wife likes a firmer bed, so I think we need medium. We are also both side sleepers.

I’m looking at Costco, and they’ve got the [Tempur Cloud Supreme](https://www.costco.com/tempur-cloud-supreme-king-mattress.product.100473849.html) for $1999, the [Tempur Flex Prima](https://www.costco.com/tempur-flex-prima-king-mattress.product.100473892.html) for $1699 and the [Beautyrest Hybrid 1000 Infinicool](https://www.costco.com/beautyrest-hybrid-1000-infinicool-medium-king-mattress.product.100512320.html) for $1499.

Purple 4 vs. Tempur-pedic ProAdapt. My girlfriend (5’5 125) and I (5’11 170) are moving and we are getting a new bed It would be a king size. Today we went to mattress firm as they had both mattresses that we wanted to try purple four and the pro adapt medium hybrid. The purple is hard to explain how it feels I really enjoyed it her not so much. Where as on the other hand she really enjoyed the Tempur-pedic and I was more so so. The price is not so much a concern however with the two being so different I am interested in those that have either what their experience is in the long run.

"In search of a TRUE MEDIUM hybrid mattress. Plz help. My boyfriend and I desperately need a new mattress. We are currently sleeping on a 10+ yr old queen sized inner spring mattress and I have back pain, hip pain, shoulder pain, side pain, you name it. 

I am 5’4” 190 and he is 6’3” about 170 so obviously very different body types which makes it a little harder to find something that will work well for both of us. We are both combo sleepers I’d say mainly side and stomach. I have decided on a hybrid mattress and am just having trouble finding something semi affordable that is a TRUE medium (5 or maybe 6 on a scale of 1-10) in firmness. 

I have considered many mattresses but we’re really trying to stay in the $1000-1200 range for a king size so options are limited for something of quality. Right now my top two contenders are the Brooklyn Signature Hybrid and the Allswell 12” luxe hybrid. Mainly because they are made in the US, with quality materials, and offer trial periods. But I am concerned that either or both of these may get here and end up being a little too firm for our liking. However I am not interested in doing a soft or plush version as I need a little more support than that. 

I have delved into almost every single amazon bed in a box hybrid mattress and most of them are much cheaper but I am concerned about quality and durability. I know that everyone is different and comfort is subjective but does anyone have some insight for me before I pull the plug and just hope for the best with one of these beds? ??"
"Are Zinus bed foundations actually good? Seeing a lot of conflicting reviews. Zinus keeps coming up on lists for hybrid mattress platforms and foundations, but for every few 5-star reviews that specifically mention durability and quietness, I see a 1-star review that talla about them feeling cheap, squeaky, or uneven. Besides that, they don't include any information on their slat spacing for any of their models, which feels suspicious. This has all lead me to wonder how unbiased or even real their online reviews are, as it seems either they are publishing their own positive reviews or their quality control is inconsistent. Wanted to hear people's opinions and alternatives. Also,. More specific question, their most popular models seem to have a metal grid pattern rather than traditional slats, but the bars seem very narrow. Does this imprint too far into the mattress or require a foundation on top of it? Thanks to all"

"Deciding between pure memory foam vs hybrid (Silk & Snow, Canada). My SO and I are looking to buy a new mattress in Canada. Done some light research and it looks like Silk and Snow is getting a lot of love. I really like their offerings and transparency around the build quality and materials of their mattresses. The 15 year warranty and 100 day guarantee is not bad either.

My SO sleeps primarily on their side and I sleep about 60% on stomach and 40% on side. We are both around 150lbs. My SO is always cold while I am always hot :P.

We decided to look for a new mattress because my SO can feel the sagging in our existing mattress. We definitely want a mattress that will not sag over a short amount of time.

"Blind purchase for a side sleeper. I am a sidesleeper who moved into a new apartment and needs a mattress desperately. Unfortunately, covid-19 situation in California does not allow me to try out a bunch of mattresses. Also, I don't consider it a decade-long purchase and will probably leave the mattress on the curb in a couple of years. I typically slept on random spring mattresses and didn't complain. Motel foam mattresses were awful 80% of the time apart from a couple of cases when they provided nice warm hug of soft and cool foam - can not reliably buy anything like that without looking. Right now I am sleeping on a 130$ ikea coach, which is actually pretty comfy, apart from being way too short.

So, what do I do? So far I am deciding between Ikeas Haugesund (300$) and possibly  Beautyrest Surfacecool Gel (firmer mattress, goes for 480 at costco) but these are more of random picks rather than an informed choice.

"Need help with bad back pain. Hey all, my wife and I are trying very hard to find a mattress that works to alleviate her back issues. We have had a tempurpedic cloud something or other for about 5 years, and I love it, but after a couple pregnancies and throwing out her back one time, she has been in pain for the last two years. Well, she bought a latex topper, and almost instantly had relief. Trouble is, that makes our mattress/topper combo nearly 18 inches tall, and I hate that. 

So, after a LOT of research, we ordered a wink. After one night, her back and neck were back to where they were a few months ago, whereas the latex topper gave her instant relief. 

I still want to find a solution that is more... normal, and preferably cooler, as the foam does not allow the latex to breathe. Or at least not crazy tall. But I am pretty out of it on what all these different mattresses feel like. 

What worked: firm tempurpedic (contour elite I think) + sleep on latex mattress topper.

What didn't work: firm tempurpedic on its own, wink luxe-firm hybrid mattress. 

My wife thinks the topper plus tempurpedic worked because of soft latex + a firm base. So, we could always just look for a firm, thin base, and try that, or... find something else. I don't really know! I do know that I can sleep on anything. She is a back/side sleeper, and maybe 120-130 pounds.

"Mattress purchase journey and why I ultimately went DIY (photo album). album: https://imgur.com/a/UfcWCvc

Roughly ~6 weeks ago I was in the same position many people in this sub have found themselves in: I knew I needed a new mattress but had no clue about how to pick the ""best"" one. My old mattress was some budget queen option from Mattress Firm that I threw a foam topper on. 

Things I knew I wanted: king size, non-wool, hybrid, not bed-in-a-box

Over Memorial Day weekend, I almost bought a $2k Avocado after seeing their Consumer Report scores. I got as far as adding the mattress and pillows to my cart and trying to check out before finding out you can either get the $200 off OR the pillows, not both. Are you kidding? 

From that point, I avoided the branding and advertising and spent quite a bit of time reading Mattress Underground. I learned about DIY there, but more importantly learned about the internals of mattresses. Pocket coils. Foam vs latex. Talalay vs Dunlop. ILD levels. Buying a mattress is about buying the correct layers for your situation/budget, everything else is smoke and mirrors IMO.

Given our budget ($1-2k) and our requirements (side / stomach sleepers, normal weight) I put together the following:

**Let me stress that my choices here are entirely based on our weight, and our sleeping positions. Everyone's sleeping situation is unique.**

- Base: 1 inch HDF from foamproducts.net
- Coil: 8.5 inch Combi-Zoned Pocket Coil Spring from diymattress.net
- Transition layer: 2 inch medium (30ILD) Natural Latex Mattress Topper from sleeponlatex.com  
- Comfort layer: 1 inch soft (20ILD) Natural Latex Mattress Topper from sleeponlatex.com  
- Cover: 12 inch organic cotton Zippered Mattress Covers from diymatress.net

Total cost: ~$1100

The HDF foam was after reading coils do best if they sit on a base. Coils were best quality available to be ordered individually. The latex I ordered from SOL and not DIYM because of the better return/exchange policy as I wanted to swap out layers if needed.  The cover is non-wool and looks/feels great!

"Mattress topper or mattress for sciatica?. I have recently developed sciatica unfortunately and I feel like my mattress is making it a lot worse. It’s an old stiff spring mattress that came with my flat, and I would ideally like to get a mattress topper for it since I plan on moving within the next 6 - 12 months and don’t own a means to transport a mattress, nor do I have a place to store the old mattress. If it REALLY comes down to it I will buy a mattress, but I’m wondering if anyone with sciatica has been able to find a decent mattress topper (not loaded with chemicals from the factory) that helps. I live in the UK so it would have to be available here. Any pointers in the right direction would be really appreciated!"
"Super discounted stuff legit?. I've had my mattress for 15 years and its a lil funky at this point so I'm thinking about getting a new one. Seeing things super heavily discounted like:   [https://www.themattressfactoryinc.com/pd.778.21328/4/serta-sleeptrue-pearl-beach-euro-pillow-top/](https://www.themattressfactoryinc.com/pd.778.21328/4/serta-sleeptrue-pearl-beach-euro-pillow-top/) 

And my immediate thought is \*is this a bullshit ""sale"" amount where they inflate the ""original price"" to make it look like its a bigger discount than it is and if it isn't and its actually a 1400$ mattress why is it on such a steep sale. 

Pretty much that whole website is like that at the moment though, and some others I've seen like macys but I honestly have no idea what to look at. Looked at the FAQ and googled a bunch of stuff and old threads but yeah. 

All I know is I'm always extremely hot at night so something that doesn't make that worse would be ideal. Found [sleeplikethedead.com](https://sleeplikethedead.com) looking around here but a lot of their criteria is I dunno territory and it just recommends casper if I do that. I dunno..."
"Mattress recommendation? + Nectar Mattress Customer Service. Hi everyone, hope everyone is doing well despite everything going on. I am moving soon and looking to upgrade my bed. I was quick to purchase a nectar mattress after watching a few videos on youtube recommending it and seeing how they had a deal going on ($399 worth of accessories for free). After researching more into the product, I was shocked to read all the negative views regarding the company and their customer service. Thankfully, I was able to contact them today and cancel my order pretty easily. They were able to cancel the mattress and bed sheet set and I just need to refuse the mattress protector upon delivery. Hopefully this will be easy as well. 

Now that I was able to cancel it, I'm looking for recommendation for a new mattress around the $800-1000 range. Back and side sleeping standing 5' 10"" and 150lbs. Was looking into the original purple. Everyone seems to like the 3 and 4 but unfortunately, that's way out of my budget. Any help would be appreciated."
"Tempurpedic ProBreeze bed frame. I’m not fond of the moveable bed frame which is upwards of $1,100 for the cheapest model plus promotions. I also did not like the $400 box base plus whatever frame we pair it with.

My question is; what bed frame do you guys use under your tempurpedic? 

We were told that in order to not do anything to exclude us from the warranty a flat base is recommended. Thanks!"
"Purple mattress softer in the middle. I've had the original queen sized purple mattress for a year. I've been getting back pain and wondered if it's because of the mattress. I noticed it is a little easier to push down into the mattress with my hands more towards the middle of the mattress compared to the edges. So to me it feels like the middle of the mattress feels softer than the edge.  

Is this normal for a purple mattress? I spoke with a sales rep and she said it should be even throughout."

"Purple mattress was a bust, need help with recommendations please.. My husband and I got a purple mattress and tested it out for about 30 days, but I've been dealing with constant back pain sleeping in it. And waking up pretty much every night and morning in a puddle of sweat which has never happened to me unless I'm sick with a fever. I've had a few nights that were okay sleep wise but it just hasn't worked out and now my husband's back is starting to hurt so we're starting the refund process.

I did the sleep like the dead quiz and all three mattresses recommended were Helix, not sure if I saw on this sub or not that the quality isn't the same as older gen beds? Unless I'm thinking of a different brand.

Any thoughts on Helix would be appreciated.

"Casper Upholstered Bed Frame vs Purple Foundation?. Hi everyone,

We're moving in about 2 weeks and trying to figure out what we want to do mattress wise. We were leaning towards Nectar due to what seemed like a good deal going on right now, but since reading so many negative reviews I think we've decided to go with the original Casper (if anyone has any comments/suggestions otherwise, please let me know - budget is around $1k, both of us side sleepers, 200 lbs and 160 lbs)

Anyway, Casper has a new product on their site called the Upholstered Bed Frame. Not sure quite how new, but it doesn't have any reviews. Has anyone tried this? I like the look of it, but it does kinda suck that you can't attach a headboard, which I was hoping to do eventually. The other option I was considering is the Purple Foundation (not the wire one), which also seems kind of new.

Any opinions from anyone that has either of these? Thank you!"
"Tempur-ProAdapt vs Older Models (Contour/Cloud/Flex). I currently have a pretty old (2007) Tempur-Pedic mattress that I absolutely love, but it's a full size and my wife and I are finally making the upgrade to king size. I went to try out the Tempur-ProAdapt medium and it felt great: similar firmness to our current mattress, felt cool, etc. However, it appears Costco carries some older Tempur models, namely the Contour Supreme, Cloud Supreme, and Flex Prima, for $1700 less ($1999 vs $3699) than the ProAdapt.

&#x200B;

Is the ProAdapt worth it? I read that there are suspicions that recent Tempur models have declined in their foam quality. Anybody have experience with these older models to compare? Mainly, I just want some assurance that I'm going to be increasing in quality from my current mattress rather than decreasing.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just checked and my current Tempur is from 2007. I  suspect back then there weren't as many models, as no model name is listed on the tag."

"Flexalloy mattress. Is this good foam?. From the website. Can't tell if this would be good quality. We had liked the black beauty rest  but I don't want to spend that much money on something that will probably sag or indent in the first year. Never heard of this flexalloy brand. It's supposed to be latex hybrid. 

Description

The all new FlexAlloy® Luxe is more than cool to the touch. Natively embedded within this advanced sleep system are two converging technologies—a proprietary cooling injection in the top foam layer, and a cutting edge in-core system and gel swirl memory foam for ultimate airflow and comfort. The exceptional cooling capabilities of the FlexAlloy® Luxe are matched only by the deep compression support of the bed’s individually pocketed coils.

A second layer of comfort with hyper-elastic foam, offering immediate response technology that adjusts to your body each time you move.

Layer 4:  1” GEL SWIRL MEMORY FOAM

Layer 5:  8” FLEXALLOY® ENCASED COILS

An engineered layer consisting of up to 1,032 individually pocketed coils allows for better reactivity and motion isolation, minimizing sleep disturbance.

Layer 6:  1” BASE SUPPORT FOAM

A high- density foundation gives the mattress structural firmness as well as a durable core.

"Looking for a new full mattress under $350. Any recommendations?. I am moving and going from a twin to a full size mattress. I have been sleeping on an IKEA MORGEDAL twin mattress for the past 4 or so years. I haven't had any issues with this mattress. I have never noticed anything bad with it as I have kept using it all these years and have never thought of replacing it. Or I simply don't know any better since I've had it for such a long time.

* Back sleeper
* Prefer a mattress a bit on the firmer side
* New mattress is not a long term commitment; I usually move every few years, hence why I am looking at budget beds.

"Buying two single mattresses instead of a King?. Is it a good idea? I've been sleeping on a Coir Mattress for years since I was in school. The bed was Queen sized, but I had two single mattresses.

Now, I got a new King sized bed. Naturally, I'm looking for a new mattress. It probably won't be coil now that I've found out its eh, not that good. But the question arises if there will be any issues in buying two single mattresses instead of a single King sized one in terms of comfort."

And everytime i go to sleep i wake up feeling dizzy and have a brain fog - im therefore wondering whether its possible for other materials to absorb VOC's and reemit them? And could this realistically harm my brain?

im especially worried about the pillow, since i must inhale almost all VOC's released from that due to the proximity of my breathing apparatus and VOC's from my pillow"
"Are Amazon mattress-in-a-box's just egg crate foam glued together?. Since I'm moving across the country on a really tight student budget, I was looking at cheap mattresses to use temporarily until I can save up for a real one. I heard about Amazon mattress-in-a-box type things like Zinus, Lucid, Linenspa, etc. but, I see tons of reviews of them arriving full of mold and/or bed bugs. I also saw someone had cut into one of these and it was just [egg crate foam](https://imgur.com/a/vb0F7sz). 

This makes me wonder if it would be cheaper to just buy some egg crate foam, stack it, and sew a little cover for it to keep it all together.

"Any DIY mattress champions out there?. My.head has been spinning trying to figure out a mattress to buy. I have a pretty low end budget atm, and that doesn't help. I'm a hot sleeper and phat boi, sitting at around 6 ft 2 inches and 250 pounds. Mostly side and back sleeper. I've been thinking the best route would be to build my own mattress. Is foam factory reputable? I've read mixed reviews. I was either going to get a 6 inch high density firm foam mattress from there and put a 2 inch soft latex topper on top of that, or get a pocket coil or innerspring mattress and put a 2 inch soft latex topper on that as well. Any thoughts on this idea? 


Also, on a side note, what the hell is wrong with with the mattress industry? If I had enough money, and knowledge, I would love to create an honest and transparent mattress company. Basically have a mattress store that is set up like foam factory, where people can try a bunch of variations of material and see what they like.

"My BB Bloom Hybrid isn’t cutting it anymore. I’m looking at Purple 2 as an alternative. Any thoughts for a side sleeper?. Hi all,

I have a queen, medium-firm Bloom Hybrid from Brooklyn Bedding. I loved it a year ago and while I knew it was a little firm, I liked the bounce and could feel my tight back muscles ‘unclench’ whenever I’d lay on it. 

But recently I just haven’t been able to get comfy on it. 

I sleep on my side and I can no longer find a comfortable spot anywhere on the mattress in any position. It really sucks because this was an expensive mattress lol. 

I even changed my foundation in the hopes it was just affecting the bed. It wasn’t. 

I now have tons of shoulder pain, collarbone pain, and arm pain every morning and a stiff back... so I’m going to sell the damn thing. 

I need a mattress that is cooling (I sleep like a furnace, I have a Husky that complains I’m too hot to sleep next to, well, he just groans, slaps me with his tail, gets up and sleeps on top of an AC vent), I also want something a lot softer that I can sink in to but also be supported. 

The purple 2 looks like it’s great for side sleepers. But I’d even be willing to invest in the 3 or 4, if I knew it’d last me for a looooooooong time of comfort.

Any thoughts or direction on where I should look?"
"Does Casper Mattress get softer over time?. I recently purchased a Casper Wave (all foam version) since it was marketed as the softest version.

I did not sink in to the mattress at all, and my back is a little soar this morning. I also have a minor headache, which might be from the smell it was omitting. I had the previous mattress for years, so I am wondering if the Casper will get softer over time?

"Split-King Adjustable Base ( ...And SEX?). I have really been wanting to buy the adjustable base king bed that is independently adjustable on each side (two twin XL's on top of the two bases which are securely joined together). My wife is all of a sudden thinking it would be a major problem when it comes to affection and sex. She says there will be a bit of a gap that forms between the two mattresses (which are NOT securely joined together). She worries that will create an uncomfortable chasm between us that she would not enjoy when she wants to lay closer to me (or for me to her). And then for sex she says it will be no different than having sex on a twin XL, and feel like we are on a tiny bed not meant for two. 

I've assumed there wouldn't be a gap, and the bases being tightly joined would be enough to keep things snug and close. Sex is no big deal imho because you pick a spot and that's that. But does anyone have experience with this type of bed regarding getting closer to the other person? Was it a complete non-issue, or was it bad enough that you'd deter a younger married couple from getting the adjustable base?

Also, I am aware you can pair the two sides and just buy one king mattress where both sides have to be the same. This isn't an option; so if this chasm is a real problem, then I'll just use our bed frame and foundation we already have."

The concerns that I have are that for the Levitz mattress I'm unsure of the quality. They mentioned that it is supplied by a local manufacture but I can't recall the name. I'm also unsure of warranty claims in the future as it appears that company has already filed for bankruptcy in the past. For the Sleep Experts, it was extremely comfortable, but I question the longevity and their return policy seems a little shady with the fine print of the ""free"" adjustable base deducting $500 from returns.

I could really use help finding similar mattresses. I also was looking at the Nest Alexander as well as some other online options due to the solid trial and return policies. It seems like most of those don't come as soft as the ones listed above. I'm looking for either queen or king size and am hoping to keep it closer to $1000. Thanks for any help!"
"Correct Fitted Sheet Size for King Mattress 10-inch height?. Hello,

I have a king size original snugglepedic on the way, which is ten inches in height. There will be no topper on the mattress, only the mattress protector that snugglepedic sells. 

What is the correct size for a fitted -linen- sheet for this mattress? I’ve looked at numerous shopping sites and sizing charts but nothing says what size I would need for a mattress that is 10 inches in height, no matter the fabric type. They appear to start at 12-inches on up to 16 inches, but again no correlation to the correct size for 10 inch height. 

I want the proper fitted sheets the first go round and not purchase the wrong size. My current mattress sheets already come loose each night so I’ve gotta get this part right :)

What am I not getting here? Why can’t I find any info that says if you have 10 inch king mattress, you need 12, 15 or whichever inch size fitted sheet?

Thank you!"

"Lower Back Pain - is it my spine? The mattress? The platform bed? I have no idea.. Hi - I have been dealing with morning lower back pain for a year or so now. The first time I encountered it, it was maybe 3 years in to using a 12in. Zinus Memory Foam mattress - I chalked it up to wear and tear and sagging in the mattress so I replaced it with a BeautyRest Black Desiree. Same pain every morning - I also noticed the BeautyRest started sinking, so I replaced it with another mattress, and again.  
I have tried hybrids, memory foam, springs, I have not tried Latex yet. I have gotten X-rays on my spine and all looks fine. I have not replaced my platform slats because I don't think that is the issue. I have tried adding bunkie boards in between my mattress and the platform, no dice.  
Can someone provide me some guidance here? Am I just getting shit luck on the mattresses? I have tried each mattress for over 3 months to see if my spine would adjust. I have read that Latex is the best for lower back pain - is this my answer? Should I replace my platform slats as well even if I don't think that is the problem?"
Roll Slats on Top Of Box Spring?. Just got a casper hybrid and i'm learning that you're not supposed to ptt 3 them on top of a box spring.  Would laying slats on top of my existing box spring work?   Or should I ditch it entirely and just lay the slats down bare on the bedframe?
"How are LilySilk Silk Fitted sheets?. Recently I bought the Pure Egyptian cotton Yalda sheet set from Pure Parima for $230, but I'm thinking about switching them out for these: https://www.lilysilk.com/us/19-momme-seamless-silk-fitted-sheet.html. I paid $230 for a set of fitted sheet, 2 pillow cases, and flat sheet, but I only use the fitted sheet so I think it's more logical to buy a fitted sheet by itself at a lower price. I am happy with my Yalda sheet set, but I'm thinking I might enjoy the luxurious feeling of silk more, so I'm wondering if you guys have any experience with LilySilk sheets."
"Has anyone returned a bed-in-a-box?. I am intrigued by the bed-in-a-box options especially given those companies have long trial periods with very flexible return policies.  Knowing that the devil is in the details with return policies has anyone gone through a return process with any of the known US bed-in-a-box providers (e.g. Casper, Puffy, etc.).  Was the process smooth, painful, etc.?"
"using a queen size mattress on a king size bed frame?. My wife and I finally got our new king size bed frame delivered, but we haven't been able to go out and purchase a mattress due to the quarantine. The frame has horizontal slats, would using a queen size mattress temporarily cause any issues to the king frame? My worry is that the weight of us would not be distributed across all of the slates and frame.

Edit/TLDR: can i use a queen size mattress on a king size bed frame?"
"Programing Richmat slash Giantex adjustable bed remote. I'm posting this because I'm not sure who might need this, but I have a Giantex R4U adjustable bed, referred to by Amazon as Giantex Adjustable Massage Bed Base, the parts are made by a company called RichMat... all that to say I googled all of these things and couldn't find anything like a manual for it online. So I was like, now that I've found the solution (ironically in the manual for another brand's adjustable bed!) I should put it online somewhere where it's likely to be seen!  


So if you have one of these beds and your remote stops working, try pressing and holding Foot Up and Head Up at the same time while pressing the blue button on the cord from the power supply (which could be zip tied to the bottom of your bed) after a second or so it should beep (I had no idea my bed could beep!) and then TA DA! Your bed might work again!  


Also if I ever buy another adjustable bed in the future... I'm totally getting one with a wired remote."
memory foam mattress which way up. i just bought a memory foam mattress and i was wondering which side is up? one of the sides has some black mat on it and the other side is just smooth. what is that black thing? also do i need to flip or rotate this mattress?thanks.
"Silk and snow vs casper vs novosbed?. So been researching the past week and landed on these 3. I know its a crap shoot on which one I might prefer, mostly curious on the potential difference in quality between the 3. From what I've seen all 3 of them have reduced the quality of their foam and the price to match since a lot of the reviews and posts I've seen were made.

Currently with the sales going on both the casper and novosbed are just shy of 1k but the silk and snow is 550 (normally 800) for a queen.

Right now I'm leaning hard towards the silk and snow since all 3 seem to be fairly comparable with the silk and snow being almost half the price right now. But curious if there's any red flags or anything that should make me look at the other 2 or something else entirely. I can afford to buy the other 2 but with such a steep sale it seemed more enticing."
"Looking for a softer mattress recommendation. Hi. I'm hoping someone can help point me in a direction of softer queen mattresses that aren't going to break down in 3-4 years with budget of $1,000 give or take. I'm 5'2 and 135 lbs and a back and side sleeper. I went from a Beautyrest Pillowtop that broke down in less then 4 years to a Casper Select which I've had a little over a month. I will be returning the Casper as it's too firm for me and increasing my back pain. I bought a pillow top mattress pad but it did not soften the mattress enough for me. Laid on a Beautyrest Hybrid Plush today and it was amazing but I'm not willing to go back to that brand due to my experience and reviews I've seen. Was looking at the Tuft and Needle mint as that's supposed to be a little softer. I figure I can always try a mattress pad with that too.  I'm not opposed to any type of material, just want something that is comfortable. Any suggestions are appreciated as I feel like I'm just drowning in options like everyone else.
Edit: Added queen"
"can't decide -- drowning in choiceS. My wife and I are overwhelmed by the choices. We're  65+ I'm 5'10 190 and wifey is 5'9 165. We're side and back sleepers. Aside from really hard and really soft mattresses they all feel about the same to us in the stores. We're looking at mattressunderground trying to read all the info on that site. We think we like a hybrid. We don't want memory form and probably not traditional, latex, or DIY.

So any suggestions to help us narrow down the choices to 3 or 4? Our budget is probably 1800s very top.
Thx."
"What are the white shavings coming out of my mattress?. My Mattress (no identifiable branding) has these tiny white, almost shaving like fibres that come out of it when it’s manipulated. At the seems through the pillow top. If you were to lay on it with no sheets and black clothing you would be entirely covered with this stuff. Should I be concerned? I’m sure we are inhaling these things one way or another. 

The mattress is likely about 8-10 years old and it was a “quality” brand name that wasn’t cheap when we bought. 

Thanks for your help"
"Beautyrest HELP. So I am looking at buying a Beautyrest Black Hybrid Plush Jennings from MattressFirm. However, after doing some research, I’ve found out that Beautyrest has this thing where they have random names on their beds to disguise which ones they are?? Can anyone help me figure out which mattress this actually is? I know they used to post comparison charts to make it easier to figure out which model names were which... 

The Jennings has : 

1” Black HybridICE HD memory foam
1.5” AirCool memory foam
1.5” Dynamic response memory foam
1.5 Energy Foam

Support system: 

1” Contour Support micro coil (2000 density)
850 Density Advanced pocketed coil technology

Total surround beautyedge with quantum lock
Ventilated AirCool BeautyEdge Foam Encasement


Which is this and what is a decent price for a Queen size? I got quoted $2800 after I said I had an appointment at a different mattress store. Any help is appreciated!"
"Got a question if someone can help.. I doubt anyone has heard of these mattresses, but I might as well give it a shot. I went to a small business mattress and he was selling a couple from this company. They were very comfy and low cost. Between $500-$600. There is very little I can find about their mattresses, however the few details i can find have me a bit worried. They are bed in box mattresses, made in China and use fiber glass for a fire retardant. Here's the website for anyone who wants to check it out and let me know what they think of the mattress.

"Mattress: Avocado Green or Purple Hybrid?. My wife and I are trying to find a bed that we know will have a good long-term durability, good support, and just overall comfort. I have seen so many mixed reviews between both companies (Purple and Avocado), but am trying to really determine the best option for us.

To give a little history, we have a kid that loves falling asleep between us (and she is only going to get bigger). I'm a mix between side-sleeping a lot, then sometimes going to the back to stretch out. My wife loves sleeping on her side. We aren't too worried on the price, just want to have the ease in our mind that we are making a good choice for us.

"QUESTION: MATTRESS FOR LOWER BACK PAIN. I have read a trillion articles on the internet about what mattress to purchase for lower back pain. I was hoping someone here swore by some brand. I don't particularly like very hard mattresses, so I would like something that leans softer but supportive. I've heard purple mattress, and casper, and winkbed, but those are all on the internet so it's hard to say and due to covid i'm not super avid about going into a store. Does anyone have a mattress they truly think provided relief? I sleep on my stomach mostly.  I should add I'm 5' 6"" and about 135 lbs."
"Tempur ProAdapt dilemma: half my body REALLY likes Medium, other half prefers Soft. Female, side/contorted fetal sleeper, 5' 11"", 140lbs, lifelong athlete now in my 40s. Have minor SI joint & very low back funk, likely being exacerbated by current mattress. The impetus to buy new one.

After much laying around at local mattress store, decided on ProAdapt. Went in expecting to like a firmer mattress because support > ""comfort"". Pressure points aside, my happiest sleep place is camping on a rock hard air mattress.

The Medium was like angels singing to lower half, where I carry more of my weight. Felt incredibly well supported. BUT upper half (shoulder, head) felt like it was being jammed into a velvety brick. With the Medium-Hybrid and Soft, it felt like my lower body was being sucked into a hole which did not register as ""supportive"" at all. The Medium-Hybrid was the worst offender here. Upper body felt fantastic on both of these.

Sales guy was great, but hadn't encountered this problem before. I'm inclined to cater to lower body because I have issues there, but know I'm going to be not-happy waking up to shoulder pain.

Any suggestions? Wondering if adding a topper of some kind will bring my two halves closer to an agreement.

Full disclosure: been 20 years since I've had a Tempur so part of it may be that I'm not used to the gooey, eaten-alive-by-melted-cheese feeling of the softer ones? It's off-putting.

**\*\* UPDATE \*\***

Just got back from Tempur-pedic store  (wasn't aware this is a thing) to get a second opinion. Sales dude confirmed what I was feeling - - more butt-sink on the Soft. My lower body also still gave it a hard no.

What sealed the deal though was lying on Tempur-pedic's 6 month old floor models vs. the 6 week old lockdown-era ones from yesterday that haven't seen much action.  I would have sworn today's Medium was yesterday's Soft. I ended up ordering the Medium, fingers crossed.

Take note Tempur shoppers: the break-in is real.

"I think my back is dead. Like it's just given up on life. 

I had a random memory foam mattress that I generally enjoyed, it worked well most night with some bad nights. Then stuff happened, I changed rooms and was able to upgrade to an older king mattress. It's original mattress factory. I hate it. I was popping pills at night to manage it. But I didn't have the money for a new mattress and someone else already took my old one. 

So I got a Saavta mattress topper. Great ratings? All lies. At least for me. I woke up in so much pain I couldn't move. 

I'm fat, I am now willing to fork over the money (or st least my credit card is) for a mid range mattress. Any suggestions? I prefer foam. I was thinking purple or casper but I don't know if that's just because I keep seeing commercials for them"
"Worth upgrading from a Sleep Innovations Shiloh Firm to a Tempur-Pedic Pro Adapt Firm?. I've had the Shiloh since 2014.  It's served me well but I can tell it's starting to sag slightly, and my Sleep Master Amazon frame is squeaky.

How much of a difference in noticeable quality should I expect to see if I upgrade these?  I was also unable to find any foundations that match Tempurs stringent requirements of having 3"" slats that are no longer than 4"" apart.  I also would rather have a nice bed that met these requirements without their solid foundation but can't find any."
"seeking a mattress that feels similar to a sealy posturepedic traditional hybrid comfort focus. hi!

so i slept at an airbnb some months ago and i absolutely adored the feeling of the bed. it felt like a cloud. i'm in the market for a new bed, and went and stayed at that same airbnb again for a night (it's in my own city) mostly so I could get the specs (I sorta half-tried the first time, but it was inside a major mattress protector which i was too lazy to remove the first time). The mattress is the one listed in the title - sealy posturepedic traditional hybrid comfort focus. i've searched and it seems this mattress is no longer on the market?  

i also wonder if maybe the thing that made the bed so comfy was the mattress topper (which i googled and it's a $40 one :)) and the linens/pillows...

anyway, i have my heart set on getting a mattress that feels the way that one did. I really don't want to go into a store right now (but will if i absolutely have to). i've lived my whole life without ever actually purchasing a decent mattress and i love to sleep, so i've decided it's time. (however, I will not spend over 1k - looking for queen size).

does anyone know this mattress, and if so, can you help me figure out what would feel similar? TIA!"
"Tempur-pedic vs foam layer building websites?. We just bought a Tempur-pedic ProAdapt Medium non-hybrid and are waiting for it get here, still in sticker shock but my back is in pain every morning due to our 8 yr old Paula Dean Serta giving out. I've heard whispers of people saving lots of money building their own mattress on foam supply websites but am hesitant to waste time doing that if it won't solve my back issue like a Tempur-pedic might. Is it possible to build a mattress comparable to the ProAdapt and save hundreds/thousands? What should I even look for and how can I determine quality? Hoping to get some expert insight on potentially going this route as I'm furloughed and shouldn't buying overly nice things right now. Thank you so much.

Edit: I should also add that we are currently sleeping on a Winkbed luxury firm hybrid BIAB that I am returning due to being too firm. The tempur-pedic buy was somewhat out of desperation but I hear they last a long time and people love them. Would love to hear any pros/cons of foam building sites or if I should keep the Tempur-pedic."
"TempurPedic Adapt vs. ProAdapt?. Hey Folks, just a simple question on value... was testing out mattresses and really enjoyed laying on both the Tempurpedic Adapt and ProAdapt (both Medium Hybrid), felt like I could barely tell the difference (then again I was on each for like 5 minutes total)... would you say the Adapt version (full size) for only $1000 is a good value? It is the floor sample and it doesn't come with a warranty, so I'm a little wary that I'm settling on the ""budget"" version when originally I was looking to go all-out... I really want to buy a bed that I'll enjoy immensely for a minimum of 5 years. Is the Adapt just a poor man's tempurpedic? It's hard to pass up on the supposed value when tempur's website lists it for double the price.

For example, I also really enjoyed laying on the Purple 3, but it was $1950 in comparison... it really is very comfortable but I'm not sure how much I can trust a new brand and the odd material behind it.

TL;DR: Is the Tempurpedic Adapt Medium Hybrid (full size) worth $1000 with no warranty? Thanks!"
Similar feel to tempurpedic. Just tried out the pro align firm tempurpedic today. Felt freaking amazing except for the price. Any firm foam mattress that is similar but a lower price? Had anyone tried novaform from Costco. I tried Casper as well but felt it was too soft

"Hot sleeper in need of recommendations!!! (Stomach sleeper, too!). You guys I am losing it with this quest. I've spent all day googling and even subscribed to consumer reports. (?????)

I sleep super hot for some reason (I'm a ""normal""-sized woman in my 20's) so finding a mattress that won't have me waking up drenched in sweat would be a dream. Beyond that, I like something firmer, and as a stomach sleeper apparently that is what's best for me anyway.

Has anyone had any success in this area? I don't want to spend more than like $1100.

(Note: 5 years ago, I used to sleep on a Casper and found it to be warmer than I'd like but not insufferable. I would just get that again, but 1. I know the mattress has changed since then so I'm not sure I would like the new one as much and more importantly 2. I don't want to give them my business because I hate them for personal reasons. Don't worry about it.)

"Mattress for a college student with back problems.. Ok so I am moving into a house with three of my friends near the college we all go to, it's much cheaper than my dorm fees. I have a good bit of money saved up for furniture, but as far as a bed set goes I'm really only willing to go about $650-$750 AT THE MOST. This seems pretty pricey for a college student, but a few years ago I had a spine surgery to correct a severe case of scoliosis and have been sleeping on the same mattress since I was about 9. I was wondering if anyone had any good recommendations in my price range. I bought a Purple seating bad to test out the material and I'm very happy with it, but the mattress is a little more than I want to pay, plus if I ordered now it wouldn't be here till a couple of weeks after moving.

"iSeries 500 Hybrid Cushion Firm. I bought this mattress over 4 months ago and I just love it!! 

I highly recommend it, while it's on the firmer side I was told it's more of a medium, because it's 'cushion firm'. I tend to sleep on my back or side and I move around a lot in my sleep since I'm a light sleeper. This is the best I've slept in awhile!

I got the mattress at Mattress Firm, where they were doing a promo (presidents day sale I think) of paying the price of the sized down mattress. for example, I got a queen mattress for the price of a full mattress (just a little over $1300 if I remember correctly).

"Saatva vs WinkBeds. Getting close to finally replacing my innerspring mattress and doing some exhaustive research which seems to be the trend of others in this community.

Based off of my research only, I thought I had singled out WinkBeds Luxury Firm as my choice. Seems to get decent reviews on here and just checked BBB and seemed to be minimal issues. But when I checked out Saatva on BBB, they had better BBB rating, no closed complaints and had over 400 reviews and had an average of 5 star reviews. Unless Saatva is directing their customers to review on BBB like its an Amazon or other review site, this is impressive. For comparison, WinkBeds is B+ rating by BBB, 7 complaints in last 3 years (mostly around return policy) and not a single customer review. I also looked up Casper and Purple on BBB for comparison from the big dogs. Casper is A+ rating with 66 closed complaints in 3 years with only 24 reviews of an average of 3 stars. Purple has A+, no complaints and 67 reviews with an average of 2 star rating.

I’m actually going to a Sleep Sherpa today to try some of these out, but what are people’s thoughts on Saatva as mattress and as a company. Seems crazy to have 8x the amount of reviews as Casper on BBB.

"Need help on deciding between the soft/medium firm for Temper Pro Adapt.. Hey there.

I'm primarily a side sleeper (but have some back pain) and do sleep on my back as well.

I went to the temper store today and tried a few of the mattress I liked and was debating between the medium/soft.

These are floor models that the rep had told me it was out for 2~ years.

Medium Pro's: Great for my back. 

Cons: Felt a bit stiff for my side sleeping habit, BUT maybe I didn't give it enough time to settle in when testing?

Soft Pros: Felt great for my side (shoulders were supported) and didn't feel firm.

Cons: Felt a bit less supported on my back. Definitely didn't feel the pressure being relieved as much as the medium model.

Now as I am primarily a side sleeper, I def could see myself switching to sleeping on my back permanently w/the medium pro adapt model, but was worried that if I couldn't break the habit of not sleeping on my side, that it would be too firm. So ultimately ended up buying the soft model.

I know temper offers a return/replacement within 90 days, but once i swap, that's it.

I wanted to ask if it would be better to go w/the medium option first (going to call them tomorrow if they can quickly update this to the medium option, w.o using my 90 day 1 time exchange) or stick w/my soft option and swap to medium if it doesn't work out.

I just don't want to be baited by the soft being firm enough within the settling in period then 2 years later, it becomes too soft, but also worried that I can't shake the side sleeping habit and be stuck with a side firm mattress either.

I'm 5'10 @ 165ish pounds and apparently really indecisive (granted though as this is a huge purchase)."
"Is my new hybrid mattress too soft or too hard?. My Nest Alexander Hybrid in Medium arrived about a week ago. I’ve been waking up with sore shoulders and a sore neck since I got it. I think part of it was that my pillows were too fluffy for the bed, so my spine was out of alignment. Last night I ended up grabbing a really flat crappy old pillow from the closet & used that instead. I definitely feel less sore, but am still kind of tight. I know it hasn’t been that long, so maybe it’s just an adjustment thing. But with this bed, after a month, I am able to swap out the foam comfort layer for something softer or harder for free. I’m just not sure if the bed is too soft or too firm? If it helps, I am a lightweight (~115lb) primarily side sleeper —like H on the [diagram] (https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/a32251240/sleeping-positions/) but with a pillow between the legs. 

Are a tight neck & shoulders usually associated with a too soft or a too hard mattress?"

"Helix midnight - good or bad?. Interested in the Helix Midnight mattress but nowhere in my area to test it out.

Used to have an Ikea Matrand mattress which I LOVED but when I moved in with my partner we decided on a Cal King because we are both tall and roll around a lot. Ikea didn't make the matrand in that size so we opted for a Nectar mattress which is just okay...we have about a month left to cash in on their generous return policy but I don't want to end up with a mediocre mattress again. When I searched for mattress similar to the ikea matrand, this helix midnight was one of the suggestions. 

Has anyone tried the Helix Midnight? Has anyone who enjoyed the ikea matrand found a similar mattress they love??"
"Will memory foam+inner spring be good for couple with back pain? Or latex+spring?. Just confused about which type of foam to go for. I understand memory foam aligns the spine, but latex also gives relief from pressure, so I’m just confused on which type to pick. Both on the heavier side. 

One of us is a variable sleeper (side, stomach and back, I know, weird) while the other is a side sleeper (moves a lot while sleeping) 

If you can suggest anything else that I haven’t looked at or mentioned, please feel free to do so. 

Current contenders are:

What would you recommend in that price range ($800 or less), Queen-sized, for 6’2” 165 lbs (me) with herniated disc, and 5’5” 120 lb wife with lower back pain? I like ‘me firm, and she wants something softer, but we’ll meet in the middle."
"Best medium-firm mattress that sleeps cool?. I am unfortunately completely unable to try out mattresses in-store, so I’m going to be taking a leap and buying online.

I’d be very grateful for recommendations from you experienced experts, based on these criteria:

- Queen size

- For a couple: a 5’10 150lbs side sleeper and a 5’8” 170lbs stomach sleeper who will be there somewhat less frequently. 

- Have been on a very firm mattress for years and occasionally get numbness in arm overnight so I think I’m looking to switch to something more medium-firm? 

- Sleeping cool is important.

- Motion isolation and edge support are important.

- Open to any materials to achieve these goals (Latex? Hybrid with pocket springs? Welcome advice.)

- Any price acceptable (within reason—probably would think twice about prices over $5k) as long as it’s good value / quality. 

Goodbed.com survey recommended:

- The Purple Hybrid Premiere (gel over pocketed coils—seems to have mixed user reviews)

- The Nest Organic Latex Medium

- The Brentwood Home Cedar Natural Luxe (latex over pocketed coils). 

- Was also looking at the EA Signature Platinum Plush (latex and gel over pocketed coils, it seems?) based on Consumer Reports’ rankings. And the Avocado Green but I worry that might be too firm.

- Also considered the Leesa Hybrid based on the Wirecutter/NYT rankings.

Any of those I should disqualify? Any others I should be considering? Much appreciate y’all indulging another one of these."
"Are the online mattress stores as good with their trial periods as they say they are?. I'm a little nervous to go into a mattress store at the moment to try out beds so I want to just buy something online. A lot of them will say you have at least 30 days to try it out but will they really come out and pick it up with a full refund like they claim?

I'm gonna do some research and try to find something I'd like so I don't have to return it but this would be really reassuring just in case."
"Beautyrest Black Hybrid Alcove Plush/Mattress Firm. I just visited a Mattress Firm. The sales associate quoted $2,000 for the King size version of this bed along w/ an adjustable base (head & foot). Is this a good deal? The bed seemed to be solid, is it of decent quality? Thank you!"
"Tempurpedic ProAdapt Medium vs. ProAdapt Medium Hybrid?. We tried out the Tempurpedic Proadapt Medium in a store and really liked it (not the price tag, but the bed we did indeed.) The salesman, for some reason, stated the only reason Tempurpedic made a Hybrid was because that was the big trend/hype these days, and he kinda dissed it (even though he carries them and had one in the store.)

Our big needs are comfort, but especially durability. We've never had a problem finding a king mattress we love at first, but it's a very short time before the mattress develops valleys and we have a ridge in the middle and the support is gone. We want that new bed feel and shape to last. So - what are the pluses and minuses of the Tempurpedic Hybrid vs. the Proadapt Medium? Thanks"

"Roll up floor mattress?. My apologies if there’s a recent thread about this, but it seems unusual enough that there might not be.

I’m looking for a mattress for a floor (pallet style?) mattress that can be rolled up and put out of the way during the day. My girlfriend loves unwinding from the day stretched out on the ground playing Switch... loves it. However, this means our living room floor is often covered with blankets and pillows, and she’s consistently rearranging. Plus it’s a mess in the morning.

I figured an easy solution would be to get a thin foldable mattress for her to stretch out on, but didn’t know if anyone had any experience with this. Temperpedic has one for $200-300, but I’m not sure I’d want to drop that. However, that said, it’s effectively create another bedroom for when multiple guests are over, which would be nice. I don’t know if they’d be foldable/rollable like I’m thinking, or more designed for a proper pallet style bed. Would that be worth it? Is there a better option? 

Thought you folks might know or have a good place to point me, as I’ve consulted former posts in here and you all always know your stuff. If I wasn’t clear enough in my post or you’d like more info, happy to provide it. Thank you!"

"How to Reduce Vibration - Memory Foam Mattress?. Hello, I've recently begun to feel vibrations from my building when the people who live in the apartment below me make noise. The vibrations aren't significant, but enough that they wake me up since I'm a sensitive sleeper. I have an innerspring mattress and recently bought some anti-vibration pads to reduce these vibrations: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BVEMLR4/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BVEMLR4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Unfortunately the vibrations are still keeping me up and I'm wondering if getting a memory foam mattress might help. Can anyone offer input? These memory foam mattresses are good at reducing vibrations from a partner who gets in/out of bed, but I'm not certain if they help reduce vibration that comes from the building itself."
"Mattress too soft in summer. I have had the Zinus Memory foam green tea mattress for a little under 2 years now. It's worked reasonably well, but has bothered my back at times. Most recently, it seems like it bothers my back more in the summer, when it's warmer in my house. I wake up several times throughout the night, and my lower back hurts in the morning.

My guess is that the bed is softer in the summer, resulting in a less firm mattress, which is causing me problems. Does anyone have recommendations on how to fix this? Is a memory foam mattress just the wrong approach?"

"Need help choosing between a few hybrid options. I’m trying to choose a mattress before the summer sales end. I’m currently sleeping on a $600 tuft & needle that’s about 5 years old. I bought it when I was 25, could basically sleep on anything, and was cheap AF. Lately I’ve noticed I wake up sweaty and more tired than I was when I went to bed... there’s no medical cause, so I’m thinking it’s the mattress. 

I’m thinking a hybrid is best for me since I live in SF and sleep hot. Apartments here generally don’t have AC and it can get quite hot in the summer, plus I have a down comforter I really love and want to be able to use comfortably. I mainly sleep on my side and stomach. I have some shoulder problems that flare up and so during those times I sleep on my back. 

Im trying to choose between:

- Nest Latex Hybrid 
- Brooklyn Aurora 
- Amerisleep AS3 Hybrid
- Winkbed 

They are all on sale and roughly the same price, give or take $100 ($1200-$1300). Does anyone have experience, positive or negative, with any of these? Are there any notable differences between them that I’m missing out on? I know some of them are latex and some aren’t... I think I’d like latex because it’s cooler and firmer, but I’m not sure. 

I can’t test mattresses anywhere nearby due to COVID."
"Good deal check on Beautyrest Gladney Floor model - Appreciate your opinion!. Local mattress firm outlet store has a queen hybrid beautyrest Gladney for 1399.99 with a 5-year warranty included.

The quote I received called the warranty ""2020 floor sample firmcare - 5 year warranty"" I am assuming this means the specific mattress was not returned for defects but is just a floor sample?

I was planning on going with a returned Sealy hybrid premium (firm) from a local mattress outlet (BMC Mattress) for $700. But I do prefer the comfort of the beauty rest and it seems to be a bit cooler than the Sealy.

Any thoughts about this mattress and price? Is it possible to haggle lower or get some free blackdiamond pillows?

Many Thanks!"

"Looking for Mattress Help - Canada. Hi /r/mattress

My wife and I are moving to a new home and going from a queen to king size bed.

Our previous mattress was a Sealy eurotop that held up well for about four years and in year five I started getting a lot of back and hip pain, as did my wife, so we replaced the mattress with a Dormeo (firm) that we both are fairly comfortable with but I find the mattress sleeps warm and I still get some aches in the lower back and mid back.

I think part of the issue is we're drastically different in size. I'm 6'2"" and average out to about 260lbs over the course of the year, I have broad shoulders. My wife is 5'8"" 140lbs.

My wife is a soft sleeper which is why we went to a foam mattress and I toss and turn and do dolphin like flips when trying to get comfortable. We're both side sleepers but I've been sleeping slightly more on my stomach since getting a CPAP.

Any ideas as to what we should even be looking at? There is almost an overwhelming amount of choice available and it's giving us option comatose."

"New TempurPedic sleeping a bit hot. I just got a TempurPedic ProAdapt Medium Hybrid. The bed itself is really comfortable and I can tell it has greatly improved my sleep. I have been sleeping longer and waking up more refreshed. However, I am having a problem with it sleeping hot. I fall asleep just fine with the bed feeling nice and cool but will wake up about 4-5 hours later, or sometime in the early morning with heat built-up under my body. I am a mix of side/back/stomach sleeper so whatever side is to the bed has a warm feeling. I previously had a memory foam mattress so did not think sleeping hot would be an issue. I was using the same Modal sheets I have used for years and then tried a nice bamboo sheet set the past few nights and it did not make a difference.

Any suggestions on how I could fix this issue?

I am wondering if upgrading to the Breeze model would really make a difference? Does the Breeze line actually sleep cooler throughout the night, or is it designed to stay cool for the first few hours, which is not an issue I am having?"
"4th of July Sale FYI: Helix Mattresses are probably a month wait.. Hi All,  Finally decided on a Helix this month.  Ordered it about a week before I would be bed-less, and now I've been sleeping on an air mattress for 2 weeks.  When ordered the window was 3-10 business days.  Now it's 3-15, and I'm on the 16th business day with no update.   

Now after checking here I see a post from yesterday with at least 3-4 other people going through the same.  So, plan for a month delay I guess if choosing them during the 4th of July Sale.  Not sure why they think a 3 week shipping window is helpful, so hopefully some buyers see a more accurate window here.  

Sorry, if I sound harsh during the circumstances, but the communication is a little in-genuine, it may be accurate, and I try to be understanding, but don't find this really helpful."

Shipped yesterday (Monday) and should arrive by Wednesday. I’m already impressed by the customer service and hopeful we won’t need to spend the $99 return shipping fee.

"Looking for a natural latex mattress, $1000-$1500. I'm hoping you guys can help me figure out what to do because I'm so overwhelmed by all the options!

I was all set to buy the Avocado. It was more than I had planned, but I figured I'd just go for it, but then when sales tax got added to the price it freaked me out and I couldn't do it.

Here's what I'm looking for:

\- as natural and organic as possible  
\- eco-friendly  
\- comfort. I know how subjective this is, but I have chronic pain, especially in my back, and I'm just so tired of hurting all the time  
\- made in USA would be nice  
\- if it could be less than 1500 (including sales tax, shipping etc) that would be ideal  
\- medium firmness is probably good  
\- vegan would be a big plus

Other notes:  
\- husband and I are both tall, I'm around 145lbs, he's around 210 lbs.  
\- we're both side sleepers / toss'n'turners  
\- I'm ok with a hybrid, it doesn't have to be all latex  


So the ones I'm looking at are:

Avocado with pillow top - currently $1599  
ZenHaven (talalay) - usually $1999, currently $1799  
Saatva latex hybrid - $1799, currently $1599  
\*Birch (talalay) - usually $1499, currently $1299  
WinkBeds EcoCloud (talalay) - Usually $1799, currently $1499  
\*Plush Beds Botanical Bliss 9in (talalay) - Usually $2699, currently $1499  
\*Plush Beds Natural Bliss (wool free) - 6in is $1199, 8 in is $1499  
\*Plush Beds Luxury Bliss hybrid (dunlop) Usually $2399, currently $1199  
\*SleepEZ 9in (talalay) $1449 bonus: customisable with 3 layers / 2 free pillows  
SleepEZ 9in (dunlop) $1349 / dunlop  
\*Awara Hybrid (talalay) $1149 (made in China)  
Nest Hybrid Latex (dunlop) $1599  
Nest All Latex (dunlop) $1799  


The ones with the \* are the most likely candidates right now, but I'm open to hearing opinions on those if you have anything to add.

Plush Beds look really good on paper, but aside from all the accolades on their website I couldn't really find much impartial stuff. That 4th July discount they have is crazy though, so it seems like a really good deal.

Is talalay really that much better than dunlop? If it is, then it seems like the front runners for my price point are Botanical Bliss (the Natural Bliss is considerably cheaper for a 6in mattress but that doesn't seem thick enough?), the Awara Hybrid, and the Birch.

I'd love to hear thoughts on this. I've never bought a mattress before and it's driving me crazy. I just want to buy one and then SLEEP."

I am a side sleeper.  When I took a video of my sleeping in bed and on the flood my spine bends concave upward very badly right at the sacra due to large hips and thinner waist.

"Mattress slants downward at the short ends?. Hi!

I looked at the FAQ and looked through Google, but the only comparable thing I could find was mattress sag; yet, that occurs in the *middle* of the mattress. That's not what's happening to my mattress.

About a year and a half post-purchase, the short side of my memory foam mattress - where I rest my head (stomach, with arm under pillow under head) - began to slope downward. If you can imagine the wall is straight and the mattress height is straight parallel to the wall, the angle tilts towards the centre of the mattress, creating a gap where the slope rises away from the wall. I flipped my mattress so that the dip was at the foot of my bed instead. A year later, it's still angled downward, although the edge near the headboard has not yet begun to dip. I am curious as to why this has happened? It is like a reverse sag: instead of dipping down in the middle, it has slanted downward at at least one of its short ends.

I'm wondering if it can be fixed. Also, how to prevent it happening \[again\] to either end. I'm wondering, too, if a new mattress is in order, though this one is only 2-3 years old. If anything, I lament that it was firmer earlier on, and thus more comfortable.

\[Edit\]

I have finally narrowed down a huge list to: Cocoon by Sealy, Puffy, Nolah, Nectar, Layla, Tuft and Needles, and Bear.

However, despite the hundreds of videos and reviews I have read, I still have no idea what would be the most worthy investment.  


If anyone has or have used one or more those listed above, could you provide any possible opinions of them?  


Finally, this is my first memory foam bed and it may sound stupid but how long will these beds ""last"", as in before the memory foam starts sagging and not being ""bouncy""??  


Thank you so much for your help in advance."
"Satvaa Review. So far Satvaa might be our winner. Don't love it don't hate it. Problem is they market as hypoallergenic but don't tell you they pump them full of essential oils. Ours was wayy too strong when we got it cause my gf and I to have breathing issues. After airing it out it still smelled like a new pair of shoes but after a week smell was usable. 

Coolness - temp neutral. Minimum memory foam mostly europop and dual springs. I am light under 120 as is my gf and thw dual springs didn't work for us on the T&N and this bed isnt too much better. We got the plush but I still sink right into the first coils without going deeper. Bed is still fairly new but pressure pts for lighter sleeprs are real. Even with that though I am finding I sleep through the night again with no more pain in the morning then I went to bed with

Offgassing-- if you have alergies or sensitivities to very strong essential oils air out and walk around on it outside for a few days. Best part was besides that is not shipped in a box so off gassing of smells is quicker and morw manageable. 

Its a true innerspring feel. There's not the best motion isolation. Top coils are individually wrapped but not the bottom ones. Plenty of bounce good for sex. We have the 11.5 inch. Bed is way lighter then others we have tried. As two f/f we can lift it fine without struggle. They also have a 14 inch version for looks.

Comfort 7/10 think we need topper. We have a tuft and neddle one but I'm thinking I want more a europop to keep the bed just as cool. 

Return -- there is a 99$ exchange refund charge if you do either but its because they deliver and pick up the bed. 

They have endoresements from chiropractic associations acredited for spine health so that is also cool so far especially since I have a buldged disc and sciatica.

Feel free to ask any questions -- this is our 14th mattress"

inexpensive but quality mattress. I'll be separating from an ex very soon and am in need of a new mattress because ours is originally his. I want something that's high quality and comfortable but I don't want to spend an arm and a leg :/ I've also never purchased a mattress before so I'm not sure about how much I should expect to pay. I’m hoping to spend no more than $1000. Any information is helpful! Thanks in advance
"Affordable kids mattress. Just purchased twin bunk beds for my girls who will be 2 and 5 this winter. I need to buy at least 1 mattress for it, but the one we already have is old and should probably be replaced too. I am looking for a good mattress at a decent price as I can't afford $500 a piece for 2 of them. Hoping to get something closer to $150. Any suggestions? Thanks!"
"Heads up on Chili Sleep products. I purchased on Ooler product in May of this year.  Total mess getting it.  Ooler wasn't for me (Turns out I like cold outside the blankets, not inside) and I've been trying to return my $700 product for 6 weeks to no avail.  Their phone number literally says they are not taking calls.  Emails go unanswered.  I've filled out 2 return forms online with no answer.  

While Googling trying to find an address I can ship this thing back to (Never found one), I found this:

I'll never buy anything from them again."
"Ordered Nectar mattress, charged shipping, want to cancel. Hey all,    
      
Over the weekend I decided to order a nectar mattress and take advantage of the free shipping promotion, plus free sheets and pillows. When getting to the shipping part, it still said free... until I hit confirm and placed order. The very next page had an order summary... and a charge of 150 dollars in shipping. I immediately emailed to cancel the order. The next day I started waiting on the chat line (Sunday) with no avail. I waited 2 hours on Sunday and two hours on Monday to never see myself below 20 queue.     
     
I want this order cancelled before it's shipped. How do I get ahold of this company? Has anybody gone thru this? FYI I got an email saying it's processing.     
     
Thank you all"
"Im looking for a very simple queen platform bed (no headboard) for my Medicoil HD mattress. Does anyone have any recommendations? I have checked nearly all the big box stores with no luck.. My issues with the big box stores is their platform beds are either made with cheap wood, strange support spacing, no center support, or really low weight capacity."
"Mattress with decent quality pocket coil to use in diy setup. So I'm trying to diy a hybrid latex mattress up in canada. I've heard the delivery times for mattresses.net are really slow, even in the US, and there are no canadian vendors selling pocket coils. 

I'm wondering if there's a cheapish mattress i could order (<500 cad) from which i could extract the pocket coil to use in my setup. the combi-zone pocket coil from mattresses.net sounded perfect...but i'm guessing that cheaper mattresses will have poorer quality pocket coils :/ maybe ikea?? 

any input would be greatly appreciated!"
"First time buying a mattress. Ive been using the one my parents bought around 2010, i think its a king/queen. Its clean and has held up really well but its wayy to big for me, im looking for a twin xl (medium firmness) and a really basic frame, no headboard. The frame I currently have is nice but its just too much for me, I want something simple. And now looking at reddit and amazon for reviews I see that every damn mattress I look at people are saying its bad, theres mold, it smells, etc... Currently looking at lessa and helix, are these companies any good?

"Joybed Sleeps hot. So i finally got enough money for mattress shopping and i decided to try a Joybed. I was originally turned onto the joybed because i'm a very hot sleeper and my previous bed was full of foam, which tends to sleep hot. It seems ironic, the whole point of the joybed is that foam sleeps hot and it's foam free and full of ""breathable"" materials like cotton or wool... but i still slept hot.

I've had this for only two days so far, and both nights i slept hot, last night being the worst so far. The night time temperatures were around 53f (11c) and my room got down to like 64f (17c), so everything was relatively cool. I'm kinda on my wits end. I got rid of my previous mattress because it was sleeping hot, i was on an air mattress for a couple of weeks, which didn't have the greatest support, but slept super cool, even during hot nights. Is this some kind of break-in thing? Do i need to give it a few more nights before i consider returning it? I just don't understand whats going on. Why was my previous bed hot? Why wasn't my air mattress hot? Why is the Joybed hot? 

To make matters even more confusing, my first bed -- the one i had before my previous bed -- didn't have this issue. It slept perfectly temperature neutral, i only ever had to sleep with a fan on during the hottest summer nights. I have no idea what it was made out of, because i didn't know to check before i got rid of it. But i get the feeling it wasn't either foam or cotton, because the cotton bed is sleeping hot. 

(if that timeline is a bit confusing, i'll try to illustraite it real quick) 

2004-2019 - first bed (perfect) 
2019-2020 - previous bed (supportive but hot) 
jun 22nd-jun 29th air mattress (lacks support, but cool) 
jun-30th-july 1st Joybed (supportive, but hot)

if the Joybed doesn't improve, i'm not against going back to the Air Mattress for a while... but then where do i go from there? I can't lay on an air mattress my whole life, but so far it's been the only thing i can sleep on. What bed should i consider after the joybed? Would Talalay latex be a good alternative? Or would i likely find it just as hot? If Foam and Cotton is too hot... what the hell was my first bed made of? Do they make more supportive air mattresses for everyday use?"
"Amazon Mattress for Side Sleeper?. It's been over a month since I have started on my mattress search. I've slept on simple spring twin beds all my life and my sleep has never suffered until now. I moved out in November 2019 and upgraded to a full. The IKEA salesman recommended me a 'medium firm' mattress because i'm a side/combo sleeper.  I bought this IKEA all foam medium firm mattress [https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/morgedal-foam-mattress-medium-firm-dark-gray-00272208/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/morgedal-foam-mattress-medium-firm-dark-gray-00272208/)  it is officially the worst thing I have ever slept on. Way too firm for me, even though sleeping on carpeted ground has never phased me

. Many sleepless nights and pain that I have never felt before and so much comfort. I have resorted to sleeping on my $9 intex twin air mattress from Walmart   [https://www.walmart.com/ip/Intex-10-Twin-Standard-Durabeam-Airbed/221289281](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Intex-10-Twin-Standard-Durabeam-Airbed/221289281)  and I genuinely receive a better nights sleep on the air mattress than the IKEA mattress, 

I have been browsing Amazon hybrid mattress such as the brands Olee, Lienspa, Ashely Signature and any other full hybrid mattress less than $350. I can't decide on the right one but I am on the cusp of a month on the air mattress and  I just need a permanent solution at this point. Any suggestions for an inexpensive plush/side sleeper mattress would much be appreciated thank you!"
"Plush/Soft and durable Mattress Recommendations. I have recently visited several Mattress Firm and Mattress Warehouse locations in search of a new bed. I am predominantly a side sleeper and am looking for a very plush/soft, yet supportive mattress. 

I have tried the “Nectar Lush” and personally found it to be incredibly comfortable, however I am apprehensive to go with them due to the negative reviews online; and also due to the cheap low-density poly-foam used in their mattress. 

I have also tried the Sealy Hybrid Silver Chill, and while it wasn’t as contouring as the Nectar, it was still quite comfortable. However, I seem to find lots of complaints associated with the “S Brand” mattresses on this subreddit. 

Therefore I am seeking recommendations for a very soft and contouring, yet durable mattress which I can expect to own for the next 5-10 years, ideally. Price range is anywhere between $1000-$3500.  

This subreddit has been a massive help thus far, so I thank you for the assistance!"

"Mattress for a light side sleeper?. Hello!

I’m looking for recommendations for a full size mattress for a 115lb side sleeper. 

I’m leaning towards a foam mattress, for the ease of delivery and the low cost (under $400). I only intend on using the mattress for 1-2 years and am trying to keep my spending down right now. 

The “bed in a box” mattresses seem like they may be good for my situation, as I don’t expect it to last very long. However I don’t want to buy a mattress only to have to replace it a month or two after the 100 day warranty ends. Do you guys have any thoughts or recommendations?"
"I really need help. I'm bed ridden, so I'm in my bed 24/7 almost, I sit and lay down

"Pocketed Coils / Latex Hybrid Mattresses. So I have been wanting a new mattress for a few months now and have come to realize that mattress shopping is RIDICULOUSLY hard and confusing. I am predominantly a back sleeper and my girlfriend is a stomach sleeper. I think a hybrid mattress made of pocketed coils and latex would be a good idea for us. The Avocado Green mattress has my attention more than any other mattress, but it is quite pricey for a queen size. I wouldn’t mind spending around $1,000 for a Queen size, and Avocado charges a few hundred more than that. Are there any mattresses out there similar to the Avocado mattress with respect to the quality materials they use? I do not care as much that everything is organic. I figured maybe there is a mattress out there that is similar to the Avocado Green, but is a bit cheaper because it is not 100% organic. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/g29nak/30_day_follow_up_after_a_year_or_so_down_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Apologies for the delay on the 90 day update, but we had a family member pass away unexpectedly... but enough about MY problems, let's talk about mattress! 

The mattress continues to be supportive and for me hasn't shown any signs of indentations. My wife, however, claims her side is showing indentation. I haven't looked yet, but the next time we change the sheets I'll take a look and update the post.

The squeak at the end of the bed is considerably worse but only when you press down on that section. Annoying, but tolerable. 

There's still little to no motion transfer and the bed is very conforming and supportive, and bounces back after pressure is released.

Overall, I'm still happy with this purchase, but if the indentation is as bad as my wife claims it is, I'll be reaching out to SleepEZ to see about a replacement layer. It's got a 10 year warranty, so I'm hoping there's no issues if it's necessary. 

If I didn't cover anything or if you have any questions, please feel free to ask!"
"Stern and Foster is too short ??. Hello, 
My new S&F 8” Rockwell was just delivered today. They dropped it off and I immediately left to go get sheets for the bed.. after getting back and placing the “king” size sheets from ikea on the bed I notice they’re HUGE. I take a look at the dimensions & the bed is 76x76 ........... I ran to my storage unit (because I just moved to the city) and grabbed my queen sheets from my last place & well of course they don’t fit. I’ve looked on many websites for sheets of this size, no luck. Any suggestions? I’m kinda bummed out about this."
"? or Nest or Winkbed - For Killer Sciatica. I slipped on a slimy sidewalk and landed on my knee. It's got a bunch of wires and a couple of pins and it's healing well. My back, not so much. 

Long story short, I also injured my piriform muscle which took revenge by pressing on my sciatic nerve. I slept on my back with pillows stacked under my knees on a stiff sofa for 2 months and that really helped. But sleeping on my mattress makes things worse. And I'm not going to keep sleeping on my back.

Would you recommend a new mattress based on my history plus the following info?

Side sleeper 
Short and overweight
Hate firm mattresses
Budget is about $1500

I'm open to suggestions and advice. Thanks!"
"Experience with Beautyrest Black Hybrid L-Class?. I'm looking to replace a 3 year old Beautyrest mattress that is causing hip pain (side sleeper). The pillow top has huge intentions in it and now the bed is just too firm. 

I'm considering the ""Beautyrest Black Hybrid L-Class 12"" Medium Mattress,"" which is a Mattress Firm specific model, but because of this they're aren't many reviews available for it online. 

I was quoted what appears to be a great deal on it, but I'm now worried about Beautyrest and how it will hold up after a couple of years. 

Does anyone have any insight on this particular mattress?"
"Is there a way to know if a power base will be compatible with my current bed frame?. Hey guys, new to the community here, I didn’t know where else to turn to as all salesmen both at mattress retailers and at my furniture store didn’t give me concrete answers. But basically I currently have a pretty low profile platform which does have slats that can be removed, and I’m highly interested in the tempurpedic ergo power base

My concern now is if it will be compatible and fit inside my bed and also if it won’t be too tall or anything. I know you can adjust the height with the legs, but haven’t seen any dimensions online if the base at the lowest possible set up.

So here I am asking you guys who may know more on this subject.

"How negotiable are mattress store mattresses, does this include frames too?. I bought a house (5 bedrooms) that needs to be fully furnished. For the past 1.5 years my girlfriend and I did excellent with a 12 inch Zinus memory foam king, however on our personal mattress I would like something a little more lavish. 

I was thinking purple mattress of a tempurpedic firm. Ive read these I cant budge on much if anything at all. I was wondering for other rooms- how much can I negotiate- how do I know the salesman's rock bottom price? Can I negotiate frames usually also?

"Quest for the right mattress. I am a strict side sleeper 6 ft 230 lbs currently on my way down to 200. My wife is a back sleeper and will sleep on her side sometimes.  She gets hot every night and I do to sometimes. I sleep like the dead and she is a light sleeper that will wake with any movement in the bed. My reason for looking for a new mattress is that I get hip, back and shoulder pain. At 38 I shouldn't be like this. My wife gets neck and hip pain as well. I'm currently looking at tempur-pedic Simmons beauty rest black, some of the online bed companies, ie. Brooklyn bedding Aurora and the sleep number. The amount of beds out there are ridiculous."
"Plywood Cut To Size or Bunkie Board?. My current bed has wood slats that are no wider than 3 inches, but I understand having a more solid base is better for the mattress. SOL Medium.

"Shipping issue: Beauty Rest hybrid vs Brooklyn Aurora. I am having some trouble deciding if I want to switch out an order that I placed.

I am still waiting on manufacturing, and at this point we have hit July 4th sales. Which leads to my question:

Is it worth the maybe extra week and $100 for a Brooklyn Aurora vs continuing to wait for the Beauty Rest. I am a hot sleeper and the reviews have it being one of the cooler hybrids. Is it a major improvement over the baseline Beauty Rest?"

"Has anyone else had difficulty dialing in a latex mattress?. Stats: 5'2"" 120 lbs side sleeper, broad bony shoulders

I am trying to dial in a 3-layer latex mattress from SleepEZ and have only a couple weeks left before the (extended) trial period ends. 

I have been in communication with the company, and they've done all they possibly can so this is a ""me"" problem. I have two split queen layers each of dunlop soft, medium, and firm, and one split layer each of soft and medium talalay to work with.

I have tried many combinations of these layers and I am consistently getting pain around T6/T7, near the bottom of my shoulder blades, or about where a bra strap goes. I have several pillows of different fill types and thicknesses, and changing the pillow has not helped. I had my partner look at my spine while laying on the mattress in different configurations, and my lumbar spine is sagging downward and kinking upward right at that T6/T7 spot. This pain sometimes radiates out into my ribs. I even bought a cork peanut roll to help work out the tension in this area every morning. 

The lumbar sag and thoracic kink is worse with plush comfort layers or soft configurations. Firmer configurations do reduce the sag-and-kink and the back pain, but do not entirely eliminate them. I generally seem to prefer firmer combos from a comfort standpoint, but if it's is firm enough to stop the sag and kink entirely, there isn't enough pressure point relief and I get a numb arm and leg on the side I'm laying on.

Has anyone else experienced this, and what was your solution? Were you satisfied with another type of mattress (such as a hybrid)?"

"Memory foam mattress possibly making room smell. I've had it for a month now. How in the world can I get rid of the stench?. I've bought a brand new memory foam mattress about a month ago (Vibe from Amazon), and ever since then, I believe it's been giving off a smell that hasn't went away. I normally keep my windows and doors open in my room and usually don't smell anything when I do that. But I periodically throughout the day close them and cut off ventilation to test how my room would actually smell. Sometimes my room has a slight odor, sometimes it doesn't smell at all, and sometimes it smell is too strong.

My room isn't dirty. I keep everything clean, change my sheets every week, there's no trash in the room, and I keep dirty laundry closed away from the open. There isn't anything out in the open in my room that should be giving off a bad smell. I've become a little OCD about this and try my best to make sure my room doesn't smell funky. 

But despite this, there's still one smell that seems to linger and im positive it's my mattress since that's the only thing that can give off a foul smell. For the past week, when I test out my room smell by cutting off ventilation for a few hours and then returning to my room, I honestly haven't had it smell too bad. Often I don't even notice any smells. Today I took off my bedsheets, blankets, and pillowcases to do laundry and left my mattress open to air but without ventilation in my room to test the smell again. One thing I should note is that I keep my mattress in an mattress encasement and it was covered when I went to do laundry. After being out for a few hours, my room gave off an awful smell that I haven't experienced in a few weeks. 

The smell is honestly driving me crazy to the point I just want to get rid of this mattress and buy a new non-memory foam mattress. Is there anything I can do to get rid of the smell quickly? I believe my encasement might be trapping in the odor so should I get rid of it? It's been in the encasement since the first day."

"Does Beautyrest make a special hybrid model just for MattressFirm?. Okay, so I've found that the Beautyrest Hybrid Collection has 2 groups of beds, one is called **the BRX1000 series,** and the other is a nicer group called **the BRX3000 series.""** \[[source](https://www.us-mattress.com/beautyrest-hybrid-mattress-reviews.html)\] Each group has four mattresses.

Is this a special hybrid model created just for MattressFirm? If so, how does it compare to the BRX- lineup? Aesthetically, it looks a part of the collection - same quilting, etc. Notably, it's listed as 12.5"" deep, whereas the BRX- models are 13-15"". What the heck is going on here???

"Mattress similar to a Beautyrest Black C Class Plush PT, but not as much?. I've had this bed for going on 2 years now and absolutely love this mattress. Incredibly comfortable for a side-sleeper, but firm enough so it doesn't throw out my back (knee surgeries/etc). I also don't ever sleep hot, which used to be a big issue for me.

I need to get a good bed to sleep on at my second home (I work 6 months on-and-off), but isn't as costly. I think I paid around $3,000 or so for it, so I'd like to be around 2 for a new bed (but much less if possible).

Has anyone tried to return one recently? If so, what was it like?

Another question, if anyone would be interested in doing the refer a friend program? I read that they offer refer a friend and they have a student discount and I spoke with a sales rep and they are able to combined those discounts for me! You would also get I think like. 20 Amazon gift card for referring me if that interests you."
"Purple Mattress - Way too many Trigger Points - Help!. Hello All,

About three years ago, I realized my wife and I didn't sleep well on a Macy's bed (king). We were hot, and it had a lot of sag inconsistencies (it was given to me as ""barely used""). My chiropractor recommended the Purple mattress, and after review--we bought it. We gave it a good trial, felt it was an improvement and moved on considering that was a win. I now think the improvement was more related to it being cooler, and not relief of our pressure points. She later became pregnant, and was miserable on it. We had the old one, which got her by (though I was baking on it). 

We later switched back to the purple, and we found that we were constantly sore on the bed. She and I toss and turn, she has lower back pains, I have significant hip and shoulder pains on it. (Note: Original Purple). 

We are both primarily side sleepers. She will sometimes end up on her back or belly, but not often. I'm 190lb 6'2, she is 130 5'.

My first thought was to try a mattress topper. We have since tried 2... (On Amazon) 

1. ViscoSoft 4inch Plush - All pressure points gone...but I cooked on it. It was a sauna for my wife and I.
2. Sleep Innovations 4 inch - Pressure Points are back--and its still much warmer than Purple which slept pretty neutral.

I realize both of those toppers are Gel/Memory Foam which kept things hotter, and at least realize that Purple being a ""6-7"" in firm was too firm for us, and we need something in the 3-5 range.

We are now wondering if we should just get a different bed. We are eyeing specifically a few different options:

1. TempurPedic Luxe Breeze - But that cost just makes me cry...
2. Sleep Number (like an i8)
3. Saatva Solaire (as a cheaper Sleep Number alternative).

I'd love any thoughts or opinions you all could give on our journey. Last night, I woke up 5-8 times to switch sides because of pressure points and heat, and we are realizing we are just not sleeping well at all.   


Any thoughts on where to go from here? Is a latex topper capable of softening the bed and keep us fairly cool on the Purple as a base? Should we ditch the mattress, and plan for a new one? (And if so, thoughts on what to look at?)

&#x200B;

Thanks!"
Latex topper on top of foam topper?. I am a side sleeper with back pain and am wondering if it makes any sense to layer toppers? I already have a foam topper which is why I am considering buying a latex one and just stacking them. These would be on a platform bed and I am concerned about mold(I live by the ocean) and support (have only ever slept on spring beds)
"Pro Adapt Medium vs Hybird. Hi all,

So I currently have the tempur pedic pro adapt soft (which is too soft and is killing my upper back). Great for side sleeping which was my primary reason for buying this as I am a side sleeper, but have become more of a back sleeper recently.

I went back to the store and tried the Medium/Medium hybrid and was wondering if any of you had experience between the two for sleeping on your back for 8+ hours.

The soft feels great for a while, but I wake up with upper back soreness.

I'd like to be able to wake up with no back soreness/pain and want to swap out my soft, but not sure if I should go w/medium or hybird (tried both in store and was leaning towards the medium, but again this was only for about 20-25 minutes vs 8 + hours).

I don't care much for edge support of bounciness, just would like better back support (firm is too firm for my liking).

"Need help picking a mattress. Hi everyone, I'm trying to find the right mattress for my partner and I. Our needs seem to be polar opposites and we've contemplated just getting two twins to turn into a king but want to find something that may work for both of us. Our budget is ~$500. She needs plush and I need firm. Note I am on the heavier side, 6' 4"" - 280lb

This is our current mattress, we tried meeting in the middle but its not working for us. Not plush enough for her and I sink too much.[Lucid 10 Memory Foam](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0861H48YH/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_00iaFb203X965)

We know she loves her [old mattress](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q7EPPDA/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_e3iaFbQS9RZS2) but that's all foam and would never work for me.

So basically, what are our options?
Thanks!"
"Buying a ""Brand New"" Mattress on Craigslist.. I am planning to buy one of these ""Brand New"" mattresses on craigslist, but most of the owners don't have a warranty and the specific date of manufacturing or other important information that I can get in actual stores. I also see many complains about buying mattresses on craigslist. I don't know whether it is worth trying to buy one of these. Is there any advice you, following Redditor, can give me?"

Best plush supportive mattress. We got a temper cloud supreme from Costco about two months ago and have started the return process. I’m a side/back sleeper and he’s a side/stomach/back sleeper. It was originally way too firm and left me with terrible neck pain. Now we both wake up with horrible lower back pain that lasts the entire day and dread going to sleep on that mattress every night. We both like plush mattresses. The best mattress I ever had was a very plush pillow top. Any recommendations for a mattress to try? We were thinking about maybe a purple 4 and we’re going to go to some mattress stores to try stuff out soon.

"Winkbed Plus/medium vs Nest Alexander Hybird medium/S&F Casset. I'm at the home stretch of mattress shopping my favorite by far is the Stearns & Foster Casset plush and I have been unsuccessful trying to find an alternative.

Costco has the next model down the Rockwell but it's in a firm and it's much too firm for me.

I'm trying to understand how the Nest Alexander hybrid and the wink bed compare as far as feel?

The castle has a slight memory foam feel you get a little bit of sink but not too much a little bit of a hug but not too much and it feels very stable, dense, with great pressure relief.

The nest feels a bit more pillowy not as dense and on the edge there is a role off feel. Some of this is mitigated by using latex topper comfort layer but it's still a distant seconds from the Stearns & Foster.

Wondering what the winkbed feels like, there is no local store.

I like the idea of finding a local store to build a mattress but no such store in San Francisco Bay area.

Most of the online stores that will build you a mattress are looking to do latex only builds, If anyone can suggest someone I'm more than open.

I'm a little gunshy in that I did the a latex hybrid online and had to return it because there's just not enough cushioning over the latex, one and a half inch of wool and that is it.. I did comfort layer swaps medium to firm to extra firm and we wake up every morning feeling like we're beat up. Just not enough give not enough cushion and absolutely no conformance or snuggling feel."

"Warning buying Nectar Mattress. I've purchased a Nectar Mattress on June 29th using their 4th of July sale and I wanted to share my experience since it was very hard for me to find reliable reviews. 

Here are a few warnings you should take into consideration before purchasing a mattress

1) You will not get you mattress for at least two weeks. Before purchasing there was no way to see how long it would take. They shipped out my bed frame with the free mattress cover days later but they still have not shipped my mattress or anything else.

2) When you add a Base with your mattress they will show a Grey bedframe but upon ordering now I realize that they sent out a Linen colored one (it's a really ugly color) and I think they did this on purpose to get rid of this color. The only way I found out is because I checked the website again and saw the tracking page again and found it odd that it said linen instead of grey. Until I checked the headboard item page I didn't know there was an option for color. If you click the bedframe on the mattress page they will show you a picture of a grey model and not even give you an option for the grey one. The only way around this I found is to add the bedframe from the bedframe section and not from the mattress page. This is really misleading advertising and I think it's really shady. 

3. Now that I want to change my bedframe (which I didn't open yet) which I only found out because I clicked on a order details link I found in the email (which didn't work till a week later) and saw that it was shipped as linen. I'm having trouble contacting them. They don't have a phone number to call as they mislead you in the FAQ section of their website. The only way to contact them is via Email and live chat.

4. The Live chat takes forever to get someone on. Today I waited from 2-4 and haven't been able to get in contact with anyone. Then once it turn 4PM it said ""You are No.0 in the queue."" and it wouldn't move from there. After searching their website it turns out they close at 4PM and the chat doesn't tell you this. 

5. The Bed frame and Mattress ships out separately and you may need to take multiple days off of work or whatever to be home to receive your entire order. Nectar doesn't pay extra for signature confirmation. This is a small gripe with Fedex but my driver literally threw the package and slammed it on the floor after he unloaded it and left it like that. Thankfully I was by my window and I saw it happen. Some other Online mattress in a box places offer free white glove service but this is quite the opposite of that. 

Now I have a frame that's the wrong color, I'm unable to contact customer service and I still have to wait at least a week before the mattress even ships out. I just wanted to warn everyone because it's been sooooo hard to find a reliable source online. Once I receive my mattress I will make sure to give you guys a full update on the mattress itself but so far I'm already having a bad taste in my mouth from this experience."

"Debating between Flexus and Spindle. Hi everyone.  After sleeping on an uncomfortable Sealy Eurotop mattress for several years, I am close to pulling the trigger on a new mattress.  I have done a ton of research thanks to this sub and The Mattress Underground and have decided I want to try a latex mattress.  

One of my main reasons for getting a new mattress, other than waking up sore most days, is that my partner has been waking me up when he tosses and turns.  The movement sometimes shakes the mattress to the point I will wake me up and can't fall back asleep.  So motion isolation is important to me.

I heard good things about Flexus and they have all positive Yelp and Google reviews, and a lot of positive feedback on here and TMU.  I like how they've been around for awhile, don't need to market their business on all of these paid review sites (like Spindle), and have the opportunity to split layers so I can customize the mattress and minimize the motion transfer as much as possible.

With Spindle, the cost of the mattress is the same but I would have to pay extra to have the layers split.  However, they have a 365 day trial period and Comfort Life Program and will sell customers discounted layers in the future.  Plus, they supposedly have excellent customer service.  However, I am a little skeptical about the Comfort Life Program - wouldn't that mean they are selling lower quality mattresses to make up for this cost?  

Could anyone share some thoughts and experiences on these two companies to help me make a better decision?"
"Your thoughts on Spink & Co (US version of Spink & Edgar) mattresses?. Anyone have experience with or thoughts about Spink & Co?  Is it a good investment (at around $2500 for their entry-level queen-size)?   What about the claim that their box springs are  synergistic with their mattresses - is that just hog wash?    

My story - I recently purchased a Pranasleep ""Karma"" plush from Jordan's Furniture in MA. I loved it in-store but was disappointed within a few days/weeks (too soft, you can feel every movement of your partner, if two people are on the bed you can feel the mattress pulling you both to the middle).  I am now taking advantage of their guarantee/exchange program to get a different mattress.   I like a medium feel (not too firm, not too soft) but I like motion stability and do not want to feel my partner move.  I strongly dislike memory foam and after laying on every bed in the store,apparently also hybrids and pillow tops (the last bed I purchased 8 years ago was a memory foam/tempur-pedic that I disliked so much, I went back to sleeping on the 20  yr old mattress it had been intended to replace).  Last week when stores reopened, I laid on more beds and ended up choosing a new Spink & Co model called ""Preston"" as my exchange model.  I knew I wanted a traditional inner spring mattress without any hybrid/latex foam BS (that is hard to do these days!) and so it limited my choices.  I know nothing of this company and wasn't  seeking out a ""luxury"" brand, I just laid on things until I found one I liked, but I am willing to spend good money (in my 40s I realize good sleep is EVERYTHING, but would also like to keep it under $3K).  This Preston model is new, there are no reviews and it is not even on the manufacturer's website yet (I confirmed with manufacturer this is indeed a genuine Spink mattress, just brand new). I actually paid a smidge less than their ""entry-level"" York model, the only difference appears to be a pillow top (I laid on it, of course).  I like the Spink story and the technology around the edge of the mattress that holds its shape (so when you sit on the edge it doesn't collapse/sink) .

So my long-winded questions are 1) anyone have experience with/thoughts on Spink & Co?  2) Is buying the ""low end"" of a luxury brand worth it?  3) Will I ruin the mattress if I don't use their (or any) box spring?  I was planning to just use the one that came with the pranasleep mattress for now (only a few months old) until I purchase a bed that doesn't require any foundation (I am eyeing the Thuma bed!)."

"Bed in a box brands vs big box retailer brands reviews. Hi Guys, 

I'm doing some research on buying a new bed and was wondering if someone can clarify something for me- in all of the reviews I see online, 100% of the mattress brands listed are bed-in-a-box types. However, big box retailer brands like Sealy, Serta, etc still exist and are priced usually a bit higher too, leading me to think they must be doing something right....My current bed is a sealy and I've been quite happy with it, I just want a bigger size.

So my question: are the bed in a box brands THAT good that others pale in comparison (and don't even make it on to ""top"" lists)? Or do these review websites tend to focus solely on bed in a box brands and don't even look at brands like Sealy and such?"
"Beautyrest questions for the Serta-Simmons experts. Several years ago, I had a Simmons Beautyrest Classic ""plush-firm"" mattress that I liked very much. The ""plush"" referred to the soft comfort layers and the ""firm"" referred to the firm pocket coil springs which were made from heavier gauge wire. There were 800 springs in the queen size base.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe the Beautyrest ""Classic"" product line eventually became the Beautyrest ""Recharge"" line, and ""plush-firm"" descriptor eventually became ""luxury firm"".

My questions are:

\- Is the current Beautyrest ""Silver"" BRS800 series a continuation of the above product lines with similar specs, feel and build quality? (The cover doesn't look nearly as nice to me).

\- If BRS800 is a downgrade to the previous products, is the BRS900 closer/better?

\- Since Simmons and Serta merged, is there there now a Serta branded product line comparable to the original products I mentioned? If so, is there any benefit of choosing one or the other?

\- I'm well aware of the ""S-brand"" criticisms on the mattress advice sites but I was dissatisfied with the internet bed-in-a-box hybrid I bought with the hope of getting something better. The foam was supposedly higher quality but the thin-gauge pocket coils didn't offer the kind of firm support I wanted in the base. Is there an online  brand/model I should be looking at that offers a very similar feel to the Beautyrest ones I mentioned above, but that may actually be a superior pick?"

Mattress Help. My wife (110 lb combo/side sleeper) and I (160 lb stomach sleeper) bought a wink bed about 2 months ago. So far it’s been fine but nothing either of us are super impressed with. I still have moderate back pain sleeping in it while my wife wants something that she’ll sink in to some. We’re leaning to get the avocado with the topper.

"Opinions on a diy mattress?. I'm thinking of just diying a memory foam mattress. My plan would be to get 6 inch firm upholstery foam, followed by 3 inches of medium foam, followed by 3 inches of cool memory foam.

Altogether this would cost abt 450 for a 12 inch mattress. Thoughts? Should I go for it?"
"Question on high end air mattress like the Saatva Solaire. We're in between mattresses, just moved cross country and trashed our old 12 year old king mattress. We purchased a higher end king mattress, a Soundasleep Dream King, and, with a 3 inch Posturpedic topper, it is at least as comfortable as any mattress we've ever slept on (and my wife and I both have back pain issues.) However, we have found that is is a challenge sleeping on it every night to keep it from eventually developing a leak. In one case it was our cat climbing up on the bed, in two others no idea it just started needing air before morning. If we had one of these that never leaked we would be perfectly happy with it full time! No worries about valleys or sagging, very comfortable and supportive, and when you have it at full inflation it always feels like a new mattress.

So we were wondering if perhaps a high end air mattress that wouldn't develop leaks would be the way to go? Sleep Comfort seems to have a lot of average to bad reviews (at least in my searches.) The Saatva Solaire has very good reviews, although it is very expensive for the King. The one key question I have is this: One thing we really love is no worries about developing valleys or sags in the king air mattress with the posturpedic topper. The Saatva has the air mattress part but also layers of latex and memory foam. If those layers started to sag or valley, would simply pumping it up more get rid of those? Our #1 fear by FAR"": we have no problems finding mattresses that we like the feel of new, but we have yet to buy a king mattress that didn't develop valleys fairly quickly.

"Buying my first mattress, need recommendations. Hi everyone, thanks in advance for your help.

I’ll be living in the Cincinnati area. I don’t want to spend more than $1200 on the mattress, and if I could get a great one for $1000 even better, but most importantly I want it to be a good and comfortable mattress. With COVID I’m not super motivated to go to a mattress store. 

I’m single (so either a full or queen bed, leaning towards queen but wouldn’t mind a better mattress at full price) and I’m primarily a stomach sleeper, but sometimes sleep on my side and back. I don’t know a whole lot about mattresses (I read the FAQ), but I believe that I like something on the firmer side. I’m 5’10 and 180lbs.

"Mattress in a Box Warranties. So my girlfriend and I are in the market for a new queen mattress for about $1000.  We are upgrading from a Zinus Green Tea we got with our first apartment.

I have read through a ton of reviews on reddit and mattress underground and it seems like none of these really stand the test of time.  Now that sounds scary but given most have 10 or more years of warranty coverage I am thinking it may not be a deal breaker.

I’m 5’6, 130lbs, and mostly side sleeper, but I tend to sleep on my stomach and side at the same time with my legs out like a starfish….I don’t know how to explain this, but I hate sleeping like this because it hurts a lot and would like to feel supported enough to sleep totally on my side.

I was leaning toward memory foam, so I did research on Tempur Pedic (too expensive), Layla, Helix, Nectar, and Bear, but I keep seeing horrible reviews for them all. Do you think any of these brands would help me? I am also okay with going with coils/hybrid if you think it would be beneficial.

I think I like medium-soft, but I'm not sure as I've had the same mattress for 15 years now and it's like a sunk-in brick :(

Any ideas? I’d like to stay under $1,500, but wouldn’t be opposed to going a little higher if needed as I know I spend 8 hours sleeping on it and I shouldn't be too cheap. I just want to bite the bullet and try something.

P.S. I have gone into two local mattress places, but still unsure.  Oh and I don't share my bed with my S/O so it would just be for me.

Thanks for any help! :D

**Edit**: So, it has been brought to my attention that I may need a firmer mattress. Do you guys have any you like?"
"Getting married in a month, need a mattress!. So a while back my fiancee and I were putting together our amazon registry for our wedding, we threw a mattress in a box that looked to have good reviews on it and thought we would be good to go. Well while cruising around the internet I have found multiple horror stories of individuals who had bought a mattress in a box from amazon that wore out quickly, or had fiberglass in it that caused a lot of discomfort, or were very hot to sleep on. Now I am trying to figure out what is our best option. We would love to get a cheap mattress from amazon but aren't sure which ones are any good and a lot of them don't have very good specifications to go off of to compare to the FAQ here. Anyone with any specific experience with some of these mattresses would be very appreciated!"
"New cheapskate amazon mattress has a problem I've never heard of before. Just bought a cheap 100 pound mattress from Amazon, and I can only sleep on 2/3rds of the mattress because all of the support seems to reduce  at the edges. It's like if I slept on the outside of the bed, I would fall off, because the springs would just give way

An analogy would be that the sides are not reinforced at all

What should I do?

Also, the mattress was vacuum packed, if that's any difference"
Ordered one Tempur-Pedic - got two delivered. Literally this just happened. I placed an order 4 days ago for a tempur cloud and two pillows and a topper. Mattress to be shipped separately. Arrived today by UPS and got two identical mattresses. Same order number and everything and my receipt clearly states being charged for one. What the fuck?? How rare is this haha I wonder what went wrong and I don’t know what to do now.
"Help on choosing a cooling mattress with my SO with different sleep preferences. Lately I’ve been researching mattress on YouTube, sleeplikethedead, any mattress articles you can think of. There’s way too many different kinds of mattresses, I’m feeling overwhelmed. 

My SO and I have many different preferences. I’m a side sleeper,  petite (5’3 120) and sleep extremely hot, love softer feel, tossing and turning a lot. 

While my SO (5’9 170) sleeps on his back and sleeps throughout the night. I absolutely hate his current bed, not too sure what it is but it’s extremely firm. Whereas I have a tuft and needle (too firm) that has a topper (makes me hot). Now we’re finally moving in together and need a bed to make us both happy. Not sure if I’ll like the idea of a split mattress either. 

I’ve noted the ones I’ve liked in no particular order. Please let me know your thoughts about the mattresses below or give me more ideas of the mattress you love.  Price point doesn’t matter. 

- Helix Midnight Luxe (medium feel + side sleeper relief. Thought I would rather get the softer feel: sunset or moonlight but that would be selfish, lol)

- Purple hybrid 3 (my coworker swears by purple, his wife is a side sleeper and he’s a back sleeper. Reviews on the website seems biased)

- Brooklyn Aurora (affordable) not sure if top cooling 

- Cocoon by sealy (affordable) 

- Loom & Leaf plush euro pillow top - (was able to lay top of this at Macy’s home)"
Comparison of icomfort blue fusion 300 vs Brooklyn bedding Aurora for a side sleeper with back pain.. Just looking for some advice on which mattress people would recommend. I get back pain mod to lower and like generally a soft mattress but not too soft. I’m a strict side sleeper but stay on my back while watching tv. Any comparison would be great! Also the prices are equal with the deals I found. The Aurora sells for 1700 while the icomfort I believe 1200
"Mattress Buying Help. Hey everyone!

Was hoping to crowdsource some feedback for a new mattress. 

I'm a 280 pound mainly side but also a stomach sleeper. I sleep warm too. 

I'm looking to find a new mattress as I'm starting to notice some back pain when I wake up. 

From what I can tell on the research front, a hybrid mattress is probably the route to go, just not sure which ones are the best options. 

I'm Canadian, but I'm willing to get American ones that will ship here. 

Been told though that the Logan and cove is a good choice and it's my leading contender so far. 

Open to everything! Thanks ??"
"I need suggestions. I plan to buy a new mattress pretty soon (1-6 weeks). 

I know that I want a conventional king sized mattress. No Cali kings. 

Looking to spend $1k or less, preferebly less.

I want a ""buy it for life"" mattress, the mexican telecaster of mattresses if you will. Something that's a reliable buy as far as quality and comfort go. 

The more eco friendly the better but that's a secondary issue. 

If you don't have any suggestions maybe you can help me filter out what I don't want.

I know nothing of mattress brands, common materials, etc. Completely new to the mattress market so ELI5."
"Purchased mattress can’t take it back. Hey guys not sure what to do but I purchased a mattress luxe breeze king that I purchased for 3k from mattress firm. 

It was a return that was cleaned so no returns. 

The mattress is very firm and my wife and I can’t sleep on it.  is there anything we can do to make it softer or some how sell it?"
"New mattress - new neck pain!. I just switched to a memory foam mattress from a spring mattress. As a side sleeper, I would often wake up with a sore shoulder. That problem has been fixed with the memory foam, but now I have a new problem. 

The past three days my neck has been super sore waking up which is new. I’m guessing it’s a pillow issue because the rest of my body feels great with the new mattress but I’m not really sure. 

I have a memory foam mattress that is above average pillow size. Is this the problem? Should I get a flatter pillow? Or could it be something else. 

Any input from anyone who had this problem would be greatly appreciated"
Updates. As you know I’ve tried so many mattress lol. sadly I got to return the Serta icomfort medium cuz too firm.  And I got a Simmons black x hybrid in plush from us mattresss. Worst delivery experience ever! But it’s comfy as hell. I like it. But I worry cuz it came and it was so saggy it wouldn’t stand up . It was hard to move. It just fell and saggy. Idk y. Most beds I’ve had are sturdy and stand up great. That just worries me ....

"Purchasing a new mattress (help). So like everyone else on this sub I’m looking for mattress advice. Currently sleeping on a $600 memory foam mattress I got on amazon about 6 years ago and am about to throw it out the window. 
My husband and I both switch sleeping positions throughout the night but I am more of a stomach sleeper and him a side sleeper. I’m 135lb him 165lb and we both tend to sleep warm. I really want to try a non toxic mattress as I am a little worried about all these chemicals the more I look into it... our budget is around $1200.
The avocado mattress seems to be popular and I like that it’s non toxic but then I often read that it’s way too firm for many. I would normally want to go into a store and try out different mattresses but with COVID numbers being so high in my area I’m really not wanting to do that if possible and I don’t know how much longer I can sleep on  this old mattress. Thanks so much for any advice or guidance, I really don’t know where else on the whole internet to go :)"
"Similar feel to Zinus but better quality?. I have a (gasp!) 13 year old Sealy Posturpedic that we've been half with since we got it...until I ended up buying a Zinus (8 inch) for our travel trailer and realized I was looking more forward to sleeping than the camping ??. I've been having worsening back problems for about 2 years now in addition to my usual tossing and turning excessively before bed and I don't have any of those issues on the Zinus. When I'm on my side the pressure points in my hips and shoulders are non existent! 
 I'm tempted to just order one with the knowledge that a $200 bed may not last long but is there a comparable mattress that has a similar feel but maybe costs more and has a bit more quality to it? Mattresses are a hassle and I don't want to end up having to haul away and rebuy something if it starts to sag, degrade, or whatever. I have zero complaints with the Zinus but using a cheap mattress nightly vs 5 to 10 nights a year is a whole nother story I'm assuming. 

Any words of wisdom to share? 
P. S. Budget is up to $1500, I'm 160lbs and tour all the positions at night (how my husband puts up with my log rolls every night I have no clue) and dh is 280 and a side sleeper."
"Purple Mattress Problems - extremely firm coils in the middle where your hips go. My girlfriend and I bought our Purple mattress almost a year ago, and while it's pretty comfortable for the most part, I've been getting back pain if I'm on it for too long (over 8-9 hours), and my girlfriend's back hurts so much, she won't even sleep in it anymore.  If you sit on the side of the bed, in the middle of the side, you'll feel 10-12-inches-wide of an extremely hard set of coils pushing up at you, and next to that normal coils that compress normally.  These center coils run through the middle of the bed (where your hips would be if you were laying down) and are so hard compared to the ones surrounding it that when you sit on it, if you sit slightly to the side of it you'll feel like you're about to fall off a cliff.  Sitting on the side of this area of hard coils will nearly put you at a 45 degree angle, as you are propped up on one side and sink down into the bed on the other side.

&#x200B;

I guess this is supposed to be considered a ""zone"" of some sort, probably a ""support zone"".  My girlfriend calls it the ""pain zone"".  I find that if I move down several inches so my ass is directly over this area, I don't wake up with as much back pain...

&#x200B;

Does Purple sell a mattress similar to this one but without this stupid super-hard-coil zone?  If not, can anyone recommend any mattresses without these ""zones"" that's similar to the overall firmness of a Purple?

&#x200B;

Honestly, I get the idea behind this 'zone' business... However it's clear it wasn't executed properly.  Instead of going from springs size 8 to size 9, it feels like they went from size 8 to size 16.  The difference in firmness between these two zones is immense.  It feels like they installed the wrong springs."
"First time mattress buyer please help. Hey everyone so first off I’m looking at a mattress for my apartment at school this fall. I could use some help I’m completely overwhelmed with all of the mattress options and styles so I could use some help. So first off it’s for me most nights and then my girlfriend maybe 25% of the time. My main gripe when sleeping is that I sleep hot and normally sleep with 1+ fans in order to cool me down. I sleep on my stomach and like a medium-firm mattress. I’m looking to spend less than $1,000 on a queen sized mattress and a cheap frame. The mattresses that have caught my eye so far are the Brooklyn Bowery Hybrid and the Casper select Costco model. Thank you for your help in advance I appreciate it."
"Buyer Beware. We needed to replace our bed so you would think that it would be an easy task. HA
Ended up at a store in the East end of town kinda next to a pizza place. The sale girl was the best person we could have asked for. At the end of the day we chose a Tempura Pedic mattress. But in order to get what we wanted we had to buy the box spring as well to keep the warranty. So like good sheep we did. Manager and sales Rep confirmed the same story. Without a blink of an eye. BUT they were wrong Tempura Pedic gave me a list of options one of them we could have purchased for half the cost of what they sold us. 
After passing on the info to all who gave us bullshit story they have chosen not to talk at all. Like sticking their head in the sand and waiting/hoping we will go away. 
Very sad that this left  us with a bad taste from the whole thing.
Shame on them for taking advantage of people during this time we are in . We are pensioners so need to get best bang for our buck without getting screwed.
Thanks for reading"
"can sleeping on a new mattress on a metal bedframe with no support for ~1week possibly damage it?. I'm still waiting on my box spring, but my tuft and needle mattress is currently set up on a metal bed frame with \~5 struts going across (so basically the mattress sags down through the gaps if I sit on it, but sleeping on it feels ok). my box spring should be here within 1 week or so, but I'm not sure if I should resort to setting the mattress down on the floor and not on the metal frame until my box spring gets here."
"Regarding cheap memory foam + fiberglass. Is the fiberglass supposedly contained in these mattresses' materials in the cover or integrated in the foam itself?

We just bought a linenspa memory foam mattress which we are going to cut to size for use in our campervan conversion. To do so we needed to remove the zipper cover and fire sock (which manufacturer claims in Amazon Q&A is not made using fiberglass anymore, but still being cautious) anyway, and won't be using them anymore since they won't fit after cutting the foam to size. Removal of the cover(s) seems to be most peoples' problem, but can't find any information about what the root of the actual problem is, foam or cover. Much appreciated."
"Mattress Quality. So I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to approach the mattress buying experience and settled on a website called mattress underground that seems to give lots of solid advice and information about mattress quality. After a decent amount of time spent on there I settled on this company that produces and sells their own mattress, handmade and everything. They seem to have lots of positive reviews that promote quality, value and durability. They're also transparent about the materials and the ratio they're used in, but I wanted some more opinions about them. Here's the link to the specific one I'm looking at [https://beloitmattress.com/mattress-type/innerspring/supreme-orthopedic/](https://beloitmattress.com/mattress-type/innerspring/supreme-orthopedic/) but would appreciate any input or feedback y'all could give."

"Looking for a mattress for seniors (60+). Hi all, like most of the posts here I‘ve been going through the rigamaroll of trying to find a new mattress, but not for myself; I’m helping my parents find one. This is a really tough task, as my mom (62yo disabled with MS, \~230lbs, back sleeper) is insanely picky and my dad (70yo with back surgery and stenosis, \~170lbs, side sleeper) says that “any mattress is fine, none have really helped or harmed him” and frankly seems annoyed at looking for mattresses at all. We started on this journey because they currently sleep on a \~15yo Tempurpedic that my mom absolutely hates, and she is currently sleeping on the couch because she says she wakes up with screaming back pain from ”sinking” into the memory foam. She describes it as feeling like a hammock on her lower back as soon as she lays down.  


We started looking at BIAB because of the current pandemic, but after reading a few unhappy reviews of customer service my mom is now angry that all of them are out to scam people, and all the good reviews are paid for. So I turned to Reddit to get some real-world feedback about people’s experience with returning beds if they were unhappy with them during the trial, and also to ask about BIAB companies’ delivery/setup/removal if they decide to send one back. Given my parents’ ages and health issues — and the fact that I don’t live in the same state so I can’t help them with the physical delivery/setup — do BIAB companies do any of that? How easy is the return process? Do you have to pack it all up yourself or do they send people to do it?  


Right now the ones we are considering are the queen size hybrid versions of **Purple, Nest Bedding, Bear** and **Avocado**, though suggestions are very welcome. My mom doesn’t want another all-foam bed because of their experience with Tempurpedic, and she is willing to consider a bed with latex for durability but is concerned because she is allergic to latex if it touches her. She’s just terrified of sagging within a few months/years because of previous experience."
"Question about pairing Mattresses and Bed Frames. Hey guys,  


 I'm preparing to buy the original 10"" tall, regular Tufts and needle mattress (Queen). The dimensions are 80""L × 60""W × 10""H.

return (ugh hassle) or buy a topper. Hi - a month ago I started sleeping on a Nolah mattress - marketed to side sleepers.  My shoulders are now killing me and several times I have woken up with my arm asleep as well and had to wake fully up and move the arm around vigorously to get the blood flowing in it.   Should I return it - and how exactly do people do that and still have a place to sleep - buy a different mattress out of pocket then have 2 king sized mattresses hanging around while you wait for the first company to pick it up?? I had been considering the Mint (tuft and needle) and went with the Nolah.  My other option is to shell out $150 for a topper...would that fix my problem?  Recommendations on those?

Amerisleep - 30% off. Anyone have opinions on this mattress. I’ve read good things on it and want some mattress folks opinions. Still on my college mattress I got years ago and now that I’m well paid I’d like to get a decent mattress since I spend at least a 1/4 of my life on it.
"Need recs for a split king organic/non-toxic. Hello, I need help! Last year I bought an Avocado with pillow top. It was much too firm for me. I’m a strict side sleeper (120 lbs.) and my partner is a primarily back sleeper/sometimes side (190 lbs.). He liked the Avocado but we ended up returning it. Btw, Avocado had excellent customer service and I would highly recommend them based on our experience! 

It’s been many months and I can’t decide because I don’t want to go through another return. We are thinking of trying a split king so we can have different firmness levels. A natural/non-toxic mattress is important to me. We are currently sleeping on a 13 yr old Latex. I can’t remember if it’s a hybrid as I didn’t pay that much attention back then. I just know it’s painful to seep on and needs replacing.

"hybrid mattresses or other recs for a mattress for a healthy sex life. Hi friends,

Girlfriend and I are moving into a partially furnished apartment. Unfortunately there isn’t any bedroom furniture, but this also gives us the opportunity to get exactly what we want in a bed.

We currently have a used full size traditional mattress that is older than both of us (made in 1993 apparently) and she sleeps fine, i wake up aching and don’t sleep thorough the night, both of us agree it’s too soft (we can’t sit on the edge without falling off). I honestly slept so well with dorm bed + gel foam mattress topper, and so did she.... the only complaint we had was size.

Now we’re looking for a full/queen bed that is new, supportive, and comfortable. I would have no problem with a gel foam mattress or maybe latex but our sex life is pretty active and both of us like it intense if you know what i mean. I’ve read that memory foam sucks ass for sex in terms of energy required. Also, apparently i’m a light sleeper when it comes to partner movement, and both of us fall asleep on our side, but she tends to sleep through the night on her back. I’m appx 130 lbs and she’s appx 145 lbs, 5’3 and 5’9 respectively 

Now I’m looking at hybrids. There’s a nice one on amazon that looks like it’ll fit what we want, but costco has a couple too. Does anyone know how to pick? We want medium-cushion firm, flippable is a bonus. Budget is preferably under $600 but that can stretch a bit if needed or be financed (i’m a little hesitant to do this, but oh well). We are college students but are looking to stay in the area for grad school, so if it could last at least 5 years that would be great 

Thank you!"

Haven’t bought a mattress in 15 years. Anyone care to update me on what is out there?  I took my old foam topper off my mattress about a year ago as i think it was too soft (i think) and i was waking up stiff and kinda achy. So maybe i need one that’s more firm?  Just a guess.
"Stores are close, should I jump the gun on Tempur Pedic? What are my other options outside of Bed in a Box Mattresses?. Hello Everyone,

I'm 24 and a back sleeper dealing with severe back pain caused by sagging mattress so I'm in dire need of a new mattress. However due to Covid, all mattress stores are closed. After a lot of research it seems that while a lot of people are satisfied with different mattress in a box brands like Casper and Tuft & Needle, but a major concern is their longevity and sagging, something I want to avoid at all cost. 

While money isn't an issue for me, I would like to make an informed decision. I've been looking at the Tempur Pedic Tempur-Flex Supreme Breeze and everything about it seems to fit my needs,it's also currently 30% off which is extremely attractive. However, i'm nervous on spending 3k on a final sale mattress, and I don't know if the hefty price tag actually brings the benefits to justify it's cost.

Are there alternative brands I should be looking into in-between the price range 1-3k that are of quality and durability? Are there Mattress in a Box brands that are quality that I've overlooked? Should I jump the gun on the Tempur Pedic? I'm struggling to find a good balance between price, quality and longevity so any guidance would be greatly appreciated."

"topper to add plushness. Hi
We're trying to construct a DIY matress. Got 3"" firm + 3"" medium + 2"" soft layers from sleeponlatex, works pretty well but my wife wants to add an extra cozy plushy layer, similar to what we tried on naturepedic elysium.

We tried an alpaca topper from avocado and it negates that contoured support that soft latex layer provides for me, essentially making it harder. Probably because of a very dense and unstretchy fabric at the bottom. Any other suggestions?

Mattress Firm Defective Mattress Question. I purchased a mattress in late February so I am within my 120 day window. While it does not seem to have a visible sag to it - it definitely has a noticeable sag in it when laying in it. This was a beauty rest and was the upgraded mattress from what I was originally considering spending because I was told it was less likely to sag. Now I removed the stupid warnings (but still have them in my night stand) before reading the fine print about not doing that (but come on they were kind of in the way of getting the cover on). How hard is it to get mattress firm to replace a product? Will the tag thing really be that big of a deal? How do I do this in the middle of a pandemic when I don’t want delivery people in my house to take the mattress away?
"Saatva vs helix?. Im considering a king saatva ($1600) and a king helix midnight luxe ($2000) and I’m wondering if the extra $400 for the helix is worth it.

"Just to reiterate my bad experience with Casper. If you have this bed and you like it, good for you.  I’m posting this again about my experience with it because every review for Casper when you google it is largely best bed ever.

I thought Casper was absolutely terrible.  I had it for 30 punishing days before I could return it (bought it through Raymour and Flanagan, super easy return after the 30 days).  I found it to be remarkably uncomfortable. It was laughably soft and never really took its full form within that 30 day period.  But that is all personal preference.  

The real reason I’m writing this is because if you’re looking for a soft piece of foam, you can buy the same thing from Walmart for far cheaper, .  And rightfully so - Casper just feels so cheap and unworthy of its price tag.  Given the massive markup mattresses already have, make sure you have a good return policy with whoever you may buy Casper from.  It is a lot of money for a slab of foam.  

My weight is 150 lbs in case you’re wondering if I find it soft due to weight."
"Nectar Mattresses Question. I believe I'm going to get a Nectar mattress when I move, but I'm not moving until the middle to end of this month and don't want to store the mattress at the current house I'm at.

Does nectar do a lot of promotionals? If so, I could wait to order until I'm moved into my new place indtead.

"a 5 year mattress recommendation under 500$. Hey everyone! I need a mattress that can live well up to 5 years because I am probably moving out of the country afterwards. 

About me:
200 lbs. I sleep hot. I hate memory foam (tried Casper and it was terrible). Combination sleeper. 
I also liked the feel of Latex pillows if that helps 
I went to try some at Mattress Firm before the lockdown. I liked mattresses on the firmer side medium firm/firm. I remember I liked a Sleepy mattress but can't recall the model, was gonna go there the following week but corona happened.

Now I want to order one online, maybe from Mattress Firm or even amazon. 

TLDR: need a mattress recommendation under 500$, don't care abt longevity, heavy combination hot sleeper, prefer firm."

"First Mattress buying abroad tips. Basically I live in a third worldish country (Uruguay) and thus most international or American brands dont get here. Theres Dunlopillo for 7000 dollars, yikes. There's some Simmons BeautyRest. Not many other well known brands I saw around, most are Brazilian.

So how do I buy a good mattress without knowing models or brands? Density or type of foam, stuff like that.

I'm getting a Queen size for myself (60kg and 5'8) and my 5'0 50kg GF. I think a Queen should be enough for our sizes and weights. We are both side sleepers mostly, rarely back, never stomach.

I liked the idea of latex but there are few models here, not sure if I should trust them. It's my first bought myself mattress. Should last for all college and a bit more.

As a fairly broke freshman I can bartely make out 2000USD for one if it's worth it but I can't go over that.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you."
"Resurrecting a discontinued mattress. Hey there fellow mattress nerds - I was hoping somebody might feel like spitballing with me a little.

I just moved into an apartment that has [a neat walk-in closet](https://i.imgur.com/6VGyqYJ.jpg), and I've been daydreaming about making the entire floor area into a bed. It's not very big \[64"" x 38.5""\], but I'm pretty small; I've laid down in there and it's just right. The tricky thing is that it's a little too short to fit a twin-size mattress, so I'd need to make my own. Browsing this sub, I was delighted to find that that's a thing I can do.

I read and read and read on TMU about different options, and at the end of it all I realized I've already found my perfect mattress -- it's the one my boyfriend has. It's not even super fancy; I think just some discount company made it. It's called a ""Bob O Pedic Lite."" Sadly, this silly-sounding mattress isn't made anymore, but I chatted with one of those ""I'm not a robot"" chat bots on the Bob O Pedic website and the not-a-robot managed to rustle up some awful old flyer from when the mattress was debuted back in 2009. And it had a cross-section!

I hope this isn't too rambl-y. I've been lurking and this seems like a cool community with helpful people, so hopefully you'll tolerate my weird post.

This is the [janky mattress flyer](https://i.imgur.com/bmGwonn.png) with cross-section. Do you think I'd be able to build my own, to my own dimensions?"
"I my winkbeds mattressed supposed to sag?. I got the ""Softer"" Winkbed Queen mattress, which is a 4 on the softness scale. I weigh 150 pounds and am 5 foot 11 inches. In other words, i'm tall and skinny.

The first week was amazing, like sleeping on a cloud, but after a few days I noticed that there is an indentation where my body is, and the entire bed is tilted towards where I usually sleep.

This is causing me to not be able to sleep in any other position, or else it feels like I'm sleeping on a slope.

When i got a flat surface and put a ball on it, the ball would always roll towards where the indentation is, on every place of the bed. The only time the ball would stay in place would be where my butt and chest indentations are.

This has caused my neck to start to hurt.

My question is, is this supposed to happen on softer winkbeds, or did I get a faulty unit? I'm trying to decide between exchanging it for the medium firm version, or just getting a refund."
"Question - Increasing mattress suport. Good Morning,

I have a queen HEMNES bed frame from Ikea - [https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/hemnes-bed-frame-black-brown-luroey-s29007850/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/hemnes-bed-frame-black-brown-luroey-s29007850/)

This configuration provides poor back support and 3 of my mattresses have sagged - either in the middle or the side that I sleep on. I have a few questions I was hoping the community could answer:

* Would replacing the bed slats with a piece of plywood help? (Should I keep the slats and put the wood on top?
* If so, would you recommend obtaining one large piece (if they make them that big), or multiple pieces?  

   * If multiple, should they go across the bed in a horizontal or vertical manner? The last thing that I want to do is to fall through the bed in the middle of the night haha.

"Something to keep in mind between PurpleMatt and Purple2. Hey guys, 

I’ve seen a lot of posts talk about the purple Matt and some of the issues that they get from them...u/Purple can correct me on this or elaborate... 

But we all know foams break down, so for grown adults, only having 2 inches of the purple grid, then the foam core system, it’s prone to break down quicker because the foams break down. It’s not the grid.

So, if you like that purple grid feel and the tech that it is, I highly recommend you go for the Purple2, because you’re getting springs instead and it’s going to give you twice the support and also allowing it to last a lot longer since sweat and dirt and skin cells don’t break hardened steel down. 

Just my 2¢ from it."

"Did I Make A Good Purchase?. I've been putting off getting a new mattress for over a year, and it has been two years since I moved to where I currently live and really have not had a truly comfortable bed in years. Last April I came close, but no cigar, on purchasing a bed from Mattress Firm (I couldn't afford it at the time, at the end of the day).

A year later, and I find myself ready to make the purchase, so I pulled the trigger. I understand that as a retailer, MF has great customer reviews, which is why I went with them.

Anyway, long story short, *could someone please take a look at my receipt and provide feedback if I got a good/fair deal*? From what the gentleman told me over the phone, I did. Note, I did not try to haggle or take a cut out of anyone's margin. I just wanted to not spend a ton of money and I do feel like I may have gotten a pretty good situation.

"Similar mattress to old Simmons hotel bed - BeautyRest Felicity Recharge Pillowtop?. We’ve been hunting for a mattress for a few months now and before the apocalypse happened, we stayed at a hotel with a bed we LOVED. I called and asked what it was, and they sent me the info sheet for their beds. It was a Simmons Hospitality Beautyrest Felicity Recharge Pillowtop. However, it looks like the model is older and I can’t seem to be able to buy it anywhere (and definitely not as a CA King which we would like).

Does anyone know a similar mattress that’s more readily available? No real issues with price range as long as it’s below $7,000 since we were almost ready to pay that for a Tempurpedic.

Some stats from the info sheet (I personally don’t really understand what much of this means but I know there’s people here that do!)
- 13 inch height
- pocketed Coil Springs with 1000 density on the Queen
- edge support is AirCool BeautyEdge Foam encasement with FR fiber for border fill
- 1st layer coil support is EnergyFoam
- deck and 1st layer top upholstery is Transflexion foam
- 1st layer quilting is FR Fiber, 2nd is AirCool foam, 3rd is AirFeel foam

Would greatly appreciate any help!"

"Dropped into the only local maker. Walked out with “custom” ordered. So I did the run around with all the big boxes, Casper, online etc and everybody on MU was telling me to find a local maker. I found the only maker in Jacksonville and decided to stop in.

Owner/Salesman was knowledgeable and answered all my questions. They had a T latex core mattress that was a total of 12” for $2200 that had that feel but wasn’t looking at that much for a King.

Moved to a 3 layer foam/latex 10” and they had a T latex 22lb topper, 1.9lb with a 3.1lb base. All American made foam and had that typical organic bamboo cover. King is $1100 delivered. He walked me throw where they are cut and made and I was impressed.

Told him I’m a side sleeper and such and he opened the cover and “fitted” me for a mattress by changing out the foam. 

It felt great and he said there is a break in but latex has a different feels from memory and that’s what most his buyers state.

He mentioned that for 1 year I can change out toppers if need be for free and if at the end of a year I’m still having problems he will take it back. 

Warranty is 10 years and such but it was definitely a lot better than what I was expecting experience wise.

Pulled the trigger and I know I could have done a DIY but with that 365 day sleep trial and changing out I couldn’t pass it up. Also helping the little guy hits the spot sometimes.

Do you think it is a decent value?"

We considered buying a queen or king bed to replace my actual bed, but the king will be to complicated to move/fit in our potential future rooms. It takes a lot of space and is quite expensive.

"Are flex slats actually bad? Why do they void warranties?.

I own the IKEA flex slats that go with my bed frame: [bed slats.](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/bed-slats-24827/)

I'm probably going to buy a new mattress to replace this one (I bought this 7 months ago) as the 1.5 inch sagging in the middle is absolutely unbearable.

We all have a specific body type and preferences which inevitably means there will be conflicting views on a mattress.

"I’m an Athlete who tried the Bear Pro. Now I need a suggestion for my next mattress.. I decided to upgrade my sleep situation a few months ago. Given that I have a wife now I wanted a king sized bed. Plus the mattress I had a Therapedic Cloud mattress from American Furniture Warehouse was sagging in the middle at 2 years old. 
After spending some time at mattress firm watching nearly every video online I could to compare different mattresses I picked the BEAR pro. It had a good warranty and seemingly checked all my boxes.

I’m 
6ft1 
260lbs
Athlete with shoulder and back soreness from years of abuse.
I tend to sleep on my side if I can but rarely am I comfortable on my side because of my broad/ injured shoulders. 
A lot of the time I have to sleep semi on my side with a pillow under my back. So I’ll be at 45 degree angle.

My wife is 5ft9
160lbs
She’s a combination sleeper, side and back mostly.
She had a tuft and needle original when I met her and I would bottom that thing out. Maybe because it was too old or maybe the material.

We both like the feeling of memory foam beds. They reduce body movements and tend to be a little More comfortable for aching bodies. 

I had one of the original Tempur-Pedic beds back in the day and that was the most comfortable sleep I ever had. It would be soft as you laid down but firm when you were in it. The memory foam would kinda grab you and you’d wake up just like that. I wouldn’t really remember falling asleep but would know I hadn’t moved a single bit while in the bed. 

I picked the Bear pro because it promised the memory foam feel. It should be ok for bigger people and it pops up on a lot of people’s lists for a good side sleeper. It also promised to be softer than the other two Bear models. 
My first impression was that it was a nice quality  build. Looked nice. Felt decent when I pressed my hands into it. Not a long lasting memory effect but still soft and comfortable.
When laying on it I wouldn’t say it was the best thing in the world though... it’s a mattress.  When I lay on my back it’s nice and supportive and you can see the mattress handles my weight Well. I still can’t sleep on my side. My shoulders sink pretty far into the mattress and seem to hit a point where it doesn’t have much give anymore. I’m not sure if it’s the extent of the cover or since my shoulder is going 5 or 6 inches in it has just hit the bottom of the comfort layers. Either way it’s extremely uncomfortable to lay on my side for more than a few minutes. I think it’s too firm soft when I touch it but laying on it with my body weight it feels on the firm side. Which is bizarre because these reviews online seem to point towards the heavier you are the firmer you need. I’ve been on it for 45 nights out of 100 and it’s still on the firm side. 

I’m hesitant to go with a spring mattress because I’ve rarely had good results on sleeping on other people’s spring beds. The cloud mattress I replaced was a hybrid and was ok but didn’t last long and gave a similar issue where I end up sleeping in a sort of propped on my side position. I’m afraid if I get a bed made for side sleepers it will be too soft and I’ll either bottom it out or wear it out prematurely because of my weight.  Mattresses made for “big” people are usually made for fat guys and distribute weight from the middle and I’m more top and bottom heavy( muscular in the chest and thighs). 

Before I sift through a thousand more  YouTube videos and tear my hair out listening to 170lb people objectively reviewing beds I thought maybe.. just maybe someone on Reddit has been in my predicament and has sorted it out. 

Thank you in advance."

"UK Stomach sleeper, looking to replace an Emma mattress due to lower back pain. I was sleeping on an old, lumpy (and soft) spring mattress for several years, when I finally decided to upgrade. So I bought an Emma mattress, and it felt good at first, and pretty firm.

However, being a stomach sleeper and after 2 months of testing, I now wake up almost every morning (and sometimes in the middle of the night) with a very stiff/painful lower back, and I can actually feel my spine arched in an uncomfortable way.

I know it is said stomach sleepers need firm mattresses - but somehow it feels like the Emma is TOO firm for me, especially compared to that old spring mattress. Is it maybe because I'm used to the feeling of springs by now?

So at this point I'm really not sure what to try next. I was thinking about a hybrid perhaps, so maybe something like the Casper Hybrid? My budget is around £700 ($850 or so), so can't go for something like a Tempur.

Very confused at this point!"
"Mattress protector for adjustable bed. I received a new Tempurpedic Pro Breeze with an adjustable base a week ago. I am very impressed with the mattress. However, I am having problems with the Tempur mattress pad. It does not fit tight. It bunches up and creates uncomfortable seams to lay on. It gets worse as I adjust the bed as it creates even more uncomfortable seams. 

I would ideally get a mattress pad that has minimal impact on the cooling properties of the ProBreeze. I would like it to fit right so it does not bunch up even when adjusting the base. Would also like it to be waterproof to protect the warranty, without being hot and noisy. 

Any recommendations for a mattress protector that meets my needs?"

"I'm really good at research, have used the guides but just can't decide on a mattress. Ghost (Luxe or 3D) is looking really good right now, so but is Casper (Wave, unsure if hybrid or not). Even some of the Amazon mattresses (LUCID in particular, but the guide said I should aim for a higher price)

Dreamcloud was until I read about their new design, and their shipping issues history.

I'm currently using a cheap-o twin from amazon, plastic coils, no foam, probably close to 8 years old. It's not very comfortable, plus my arms hang off the side and I get wicked elbow joint pain.

I'm looking to upgrade to queen size wish an adjustable base (reading/TV but may try zero-g and anti-snore-- probably get a cheapish one from Amazon). In mattress I think I want something plush/soft, I remember one from a fancy hotel I stayed in once and it was amazing, the firm ones in cheap hotels kind suck. I sleep on side mostly, but also sleep on back occasionally. I'm typically a very hot sleeper so anything that cools well is very appealing.

Given current events and unknowing how long they will last, trying out any mattresses in person isn't really an option.

My price range is anywhere from 1k-3k.

Some random questions:
Do mattress protector and sheets ruin the cooling effects that some mattresses offer?

What *really* is the different than dense foam base and spring base(hybrid)? Do springs really cool that much more, even in the case of these cooling foams?

Thanks."

"Free shipping/return firm spring matress? (Like Endy, Casper, Hamuq...). Hi! I am shopping for a new king mattress for my husband (back sleeper) and I (side). Since I don’t feel like trying in-store (COVID-19), I am highly interested in mattresses that you can purchase online, try for a couple of nights and then return for free (like Casper, Endy, Juno, Hamuq...). However, it seems like all these companies offer matteesses that are foam/soft. My husband and I enjoy a firm spring mattress. Even the Casper hybrid seems too soft to me. Any companies of this type that sell firmer matresses? We are on a budget and our maximum budget for a king-size mattress is 1100$"
"Which IKEA mattress is good for a stomach sleeper?. I'm a student moving out of university dorms and holy fuck my back hurts. My dorm mattresses is a spring with a big dip in the middle which is why my lower/mid back is hurting. I'm exclusively a stomach sleeper, I don't move around at night. 

I was thinking that I need a firm mattress so that my stomach doesn't dip in but I don't really know. 

I'm on a student budget so IKEA is really the only place to get a decent mattress for myself. I'm 5'5/167cm and 130lbs/59kg. I'm going to get a full mattress."
"Puffy Royal or Purple?. I've been sleeping on a Puffy Royal the past few days and it is comfy to say the least but i feel like their is so much foam packed into it even with the Cooling layer that keeps the warmth out that it still gets tremendously hot and I end up taking the blankets off.

Is Purple better?"
"Advice on a cheap but comfortable mattress?. Hi there,

My boyfriend and I are in a bit of a dilemma. We are moving and need to buy a new mattress, but with all of our moving expenses getting something expensive, even with financing, isn't seeming realistic right now. We are both thinking that there exists, on the internet somewhere, the thing that we need at the right price.

He has back pain and I have fibromyalgia. He's a skinny back sleeper and I am a thicc side sleeper. We went to Mattress Firm and tried out mattresses, and we really, really liked the Sealy Posturpedic Silver Plush, and the Purple Mattress. Thing is, both are $1999 and we were only approved for $1500 of financing.

He likes soft since he's a back sleeper. I like soft but without any sinking because I tend to need to move in the night because of the pain. Both of these mattresses provided optimal support and plushness. I think a hybrid mattress is the way to go, and there are plenty of hybrids available on Amazon but I don't want to order an entire mattress without anything but reviews to go by.

So, those of you who've maybe been around the mattress depot a few times, can you suggest a soft but supportive mattress with little to no sinking under $500? Does such a thing exist?"
"Does polyfoam comfort layer sleep hot or cool? In comparison to memory foam and latex?. Pocket coil mattresses usually have a 2-3"" comfort layer. Polyfoam is cheap and feels comfortable. How does it do temperature wise compared to memory foam and latex alternatives?   


Thank you"
First time mattress buyers looking for advice. Hi everyone. My girlfriend and I are looking to buy a mattress for the first time. We are nervous about going to stores in person given the current situation with Corvid-19. My girlfriend is a side sleeper but I prefer to sleep on my back. We were looking at casper but I saw some mixed reviews on here. We have a budget of about $1200 and would prefer a king but I don't even know if thats a reasonable expectation for a king. Any advice would be super appreciated since neither of us really know what we are doing.  Thanks!
Upgrading a Sleep Number S3 mattress?. Bought a sleep number S3 mattress that comes with SleepIQ abilities. I was wondering if I could change the pump to use a 360SIQ01D pump from a 360 bed and get some of the functionality of a 360? Like the responsive air technology. Has anyone tried connecting a 360 pump to a legacy mattress?
"Looking for a cheap, good quality memory foam full size bed. Down sizing my bed since my college has closed and i moved back home. I have an old, low quality random queen bed but it takes up my entire room and ive been looking for a reason to get rid of it.

I am a stomach sleeper and sleep hot. I really dont want anything fancy because i cant really afford it and i will be gone again at the start of fall semester. With a quick google search i looked into Zinus. After reading some reviews it seems that the quality is extremely hit or miss, more often miss. One of their full size beds is in the $260 range and i feel like that is an awesome price, but yet again I know nothing about beds.

If its possible, im looking for a full memory foam bed under $350? Is that an okay range...? It sounds way too low. But again, i have no idea and id love to hear some of your suggestions :)

Throw any websites at me! My bed is just on a box spring, so id also need a new boxspring or a cheap set to put my bed on."
"Purchasing a returned mattress?. I have been mattress shopping and found a sterns and foster pillow top I liked priced at $2500 and the salesman advised there is a returned mattress of that type available for $900. It wouldn’t come with a warranty as a new one would, and would have been used for less than 120 days as is the return policy. I’m looking to get a great mattress to last, is it risky getting one like this, or is this actually a great opportunity? Thanks."
"Leesa Hybrid Question. Hey all I got the Leesa hybrid because wirecuter gave it rave reviews but have been having trouble with upper back pain when I wake up. (this is if I sleep on my back). I am a side sleep/back sleep combination sleeper. I been trying to see if its a break in period but doesn't seem to get better. Any suggestions? I thought about the purple but I keep seeing people saying it only last like a year or hate it immediately.

Not even sure if its possible to return the mattress in current circumstances though."
"She wants very soft, I want very firm - WTF can we do?. Is the only option for us a fancy air mattress (sleep number, etc.) or jamming two twins together?  Is there a meet-in-the-middle mattress people in my situation like?

"Mattress Firm and the Covid-19, and mattresses in general.. Hey guys, 

Some people have noticed that I’ve been off and on with comments, and I try to be as helpful as I possibly can when it comes to my own opinions and thoughts. 

I wanted to make this post because as a company, MattFirm has decided that instead of dying due to unforeseen circumstances, they have put a few employees in furlough and have closed a few stores down for the time being. 

Why this matters here: 

1.) If you have shopped at MattFirm or were considering it, it is possible a store near you was effected, always call and see. Every store has changed to reduced hours for now, so it’s possible they might not open until later or close sooner than our normal times. 

2.) If you wanted to try some beds out, you might have to wait or go to another store near you.

3.) If you have any issues with a MattFirm bed that you have bought, our corporate office is working remotely for the most part, so our warranty department is still up and running. 

I wanted to make this post to say that I personally have not been put on furlough, and in general, we are corporate, with a few franchise stores here and there in the Midwest, so if one of your stores was effected and you had questions or need to finish paying for a bed, or anything... reach out to me via DM or any other MattFirm worker that wants to step up, and I can help you out from my end. 

If you were on the edge of buying a bed, some delivery times might be effected, but I’m pretty sure that’s everywhere and everyone. But if you were on the cusp, reach out to me and we can see how to get you set up. 


In general:

There might be a lot of people that no longer have their doors open, or that keep their doors open. Just remember this when trying to get a new bed if you still are. 

Also, pay attention to a business and see what their policies are, if let’s say they can’t afford to close shop for a month and they die out as a company, are you covered? 

Also, watch for clearance beds (Us included) in the next few months... I, personally, stand behind our clearance beds, but we are estimating that an influx of people who qualify might try to return the beds to “get a clean one”, so if you have a business that sells you clearance beds... really make sure about what their policies are on them and what kind of beds they are selling in clearance. 

Also, shipping delays. Some companies use materials and parts from outside the US, and I know this is a global subreddit, but a lot of us are in the US. Some businesses won’t have stock or won’t be able to get stock in a quick fashion with factories shutting down, or materials not getting imported if it’s from outside the US. 

Be patient. Be educated. It happens, it’s something new for all of us. 

Also... just a personal note, be kind to the sales folks. I know there are sleezebags, there’s some in every industry. But, I put myself on here and out in my field because I personally care, and I know I’m not the only one. And a lot of us are commission based. And right now is not really great times for us. I don’t want to defend or justify rudeness or attitude. But... just be kind to the reps you talk to if something isn’t going right. 

That’s my PSA for the day. Y’all stay clean and safe!"
"Avocado Green vs. Leesa Hybrid vs. Charles P Rogers vs. Tempurpedic.... down the mattress rabbit hole. My husband is a 5'10"" 175lb side sleeper who sleeps hot.  Any thoughts on the above mattresses?  Wirecutter recommends Lessa Hybrid, Consumer Reports recommends Avocado Green or Charles P Rogers, I have had a Tempurpedic for the last 20 years with mixed results (sleeps hot, loses support over time)...... not sure which one to go with or who to trust."
"Showroom mattress?. Hi! Anyone ever bought a showroom mattress? A salesman offered me a very good price on my dream mattress, but it’s from the showroom. I am skeptical, but dont know why. We would still have the 10-year warranty from the day of the delivery. Any positive/negative experience with buying a showroom mattress? Thanks!"
"Tempur-Pedic Luxe breeze king (soft). Just wanted to give my review on this mattress.

So i dropped 6500 on this mattress with a ergo base, and i do not feel like this mattress is even remotely close to the investment. First off, it is comfortable and sleeps really cool and yes i have an adjustable base, but it is not a sleep coma like it truly should be. However, with that being said it is pretty damn hard to sleep on anything else. It really is a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. 

Perhaps, if i would have chosen the firm version it might have been better, but after 10 months the fact i can already feel the supporting material losing its integrity is a shame. 

I truly do feel like i this was a regrettable purchase not only due to the cost, but also because of the threshold i am now accustomed to. If you are even remotely interested in this mattress make damn sure you spend plenty of time on the demo."
"Memory Foam Hater needs more Spring for his Love Life. Hey all,

New here so I apologize if things like this have been covered a ton already. 

I got the Loom & Leaf Relaxed Firm about 4 years ago and hate it. 

The L&L was an impulsive buy and I didn’t put a ton of thought into it. I had just had lumbar surgery on my back and for some reason thought memory foam was my best bet even though I hadn’t even been bothered to test one and had never owned one before. The Loom & Leaf is just too hot and suffocating and I hate how much effort it takes to just roll over and my back feels worse each morning. 

I know it sounds crazy to by another mattress from Saatva but the reviews for the Saatva mattress seem pretty great and I like the feel of innerspring with a pillow or euro top. 

I’m primarily a side sleeper. Sometimes back and never stomach. I’m 36 years old, 6’4, 195lbs, have bad lower and mid back pain (hence the surgery) and I sleep hot. I’m single so don’t need to take into account anyone else, except for my dog but he seems chill with whatever I choose. My budget is around 4K. I’d rather go lower but would go higher. 

I went and tested the Avocado and liked it a lot but not enough to say “I need this mattress right now.” 

I know that it’s not a reliable brand but I went into a mattress store and really liked the feel of the CHATTAM & WELLS KINGSTON natural latex Euro top mattress. It was plush but I also felt it pushing back on me which I really liked. What do you call that? The pushback? Anyway the link is here 

https://mattressstoreslosangeles.com/products/chattam-wells-mattress-kingston-natural-latex-euro-top-mattress

I’ve been on every single mattress review site but they all seem paid off. They never have a bad thing to say about anything. Somehow every single mattress out there rates between a 9.4-9.6. I also almost always disagree with consumerreports about any product so don’t trust their opinion. 

Anyone have any ideas of mattresses I should check out that would suit my needs? Anyone love the Saatva? Thanks!"
"Searched for 3 Months: Need to make my own.... I’ve recently moved and I’m sizing up to a King and I’ve laid on mattresses from the Bed in a Box and typical Mattress Stores. 

I’m looking at a medium plush. Support but a slight sinking. Every mattress had a hit or miss and then I found this sub.

I am 6’3” and 240lbs side sleeper and would like a cool bed. My budget is $1000 and so I can get a good DIY but I’m not sure on the sizing. 

Should I run a 6” or 8” with a 3” soft and medium topper? This way I can change up the feel? 

I’ve looked at DIY but I could do foam by mail. 

Appreciate the help!"
"Needing help with new mattress!!. Hey guys, me and my husband have had our mattress for about 9 years is a memory foam firm mattress In the last few years after giving child birth and now having chronic hip pain and lower back pain from it I HATE it.

"Disappointed with my new Sleep Number Bed P5 that replaced my 14yo 5000 Sleep# bed. So My wife and I had a sleep number P5000 bed we got 14 years ago and we loved it, but the remotes were not readable anymore and the pillow top and foam was getting worn so we decided to get a new P5 as we loved the old bed. The new P5 seams like a cheap air mattress with cheap foam on top. It's no where near as nice as the old one was. Anyone else notice this? Motion transfer is really bad, but unzipping the air bags helped some. Plus the side wall foam has no support.. I recently came across Personal Comfort A8 model and the Innomax Medallion and am thinking about getting one of those 2 but can't decide which. The A8 looks like it's built better like the old Sleep# we had was... Worst part is the delivery dudes took my old sleep # bed away so it's long gone now... Any experience with any of these?"
Hoping that my dream bed goes down in price a bit.... Have any of you ever laid on a beauty rest black… Specifically the Natasha… It’s beautiful… I don’t think my back has ever been at such peace… I want this bed so bad but I don’t know if I can bring myself to spend $3500 on it because I’m a poor cookie and that’s a lot of money that’s like rent three times
"Need help making my Tuft n Needle more comfortable. I’ve had my full size 10-inch tuft n need for about 8 months now. The first 2 months were great. It felt amazing compared to the other mattress I had before. But then as time went on, I developed A LOT of back and neck pain.

This mattress is way too firm for me. I have scoliosis and I’m convinced this has made it worse. I’m a side sleeper, so this was the wrong choose for me.

I’m currently using it on my floor with no bed frame. I don’t know if that actually makes a difference, but wanted to mentioned it Incase it does.

However, I can’t afford to buy another mattress right now, so I need to find a way to make this one more comfortable. Any suggestions?

"SleepNumber adjustable base question. Please help!. Wife and I did the whole SleepNumber thing, the mattress was awful, we returned it. As most of you know we had to keep the bed frame and adjustable base, because that’s what the fine print says. We recently got a Serta which we love but it is one piece instead of 2 separate sides, like our base is. Does anyone know if there is a way to make the adjustable base move as one piece? It’s getting pretty annoying having to use the remote to move each side a little bit up or down so that we can get it to match. The moving guy said it’s possible to re program the remote, but I’m not sure how true this was. Thanks in advance for any help!"
"NEED to replace 16 year old Simmons Beautyrest - no idea the model - pic included. https://imgur.com/a/84JnqMW

Good morning! My wife and I (mostly me) are severely in need of a new mattress. We bought this mattress when we were married in 2005. It went in to a guest bedroom for about 5 years when we were in a place where we could fit a king size bed and had a Denver mattress that was ok to sleep on, no complaints really.

After moving 4 states, and having kids use it as a jungle gym when stored on its side (hanging on it and folding it in half to be able to “fling” themselves backwards), the bed has new developed a severe sag on my side of the bed, which includes nasty upper back pain every morning.

We loved this mattress, it was the perfect firmness for us and we would love something as close to it as possible. The tag is long gone so I have no idea if there is a specific model, I included a pic of the beautyrest tag for reference.

For reference I’m 6’6” and 215 pounds and have VERY broad shoulders (6’11” wingspan). I sleep warm.

Thanks for your help!"

"Looking for recommendations. Hi all, with the current state of things it’s not possible for me to go physically look at mattresses. I’m 5’8, 140 lbs. I’m currently sleeping on my parents old mattress, it’s not great. I’m moving in the next month and would love to have a new mattress in my new place. I am a stomach sleeper, trying to transition out of it. I am finding back sleeping to be my next preference. I have slept on memory foam toppers and didn’t really like it. I can’t speak on the quality of those mattresses or toppers but I didn’t like how I sunk in. I don’t sleep hot but I can sometimes be an edge sleeper. My budget would max out around $1400 but obviously I would prefer less. Thanks in advance!"

"Your Input in My Search For New King Latex Hybrid. I've been digging through posts as I'm far down the rabbit hole in my online search for a new mattress. Hoping to get some insight from the [r/Mattress](https://new.reddit.com/r/Mattress/) crowd!

I'm **6'4"" 215# (side/back)** and my wife is around **5'2"" 120# (side)** and we're currently sleeping on a King Sleep Science memory foam mattress from Costco with two-inch latex topper. Our ideal budget for the new mattress is **$1,500-$2,000**.

I've narrowed our search to **Latex Hybrids**. Really considering WinkBeds EcoCloud Hybrid, Avocado Green Mattress, Brooklyn Bedding Bloom Hybrid, and Brentwood Home Cedar Natural Luxe. Once was considering Luma Sleep Natural Latex Hybrid, Arizona Premium Mattress Ultimate Hybrid, Nest Bedding Natural Hybrid Latex, and EcoSleep Hybrid—*but have moved away from those for one reason or another.* I have not looked much into traditional mattress companies as pricing for what we're looking for seems to be well over our budget.

**Free returns** and **high quality materials (also hypoallergenic)** are important. Probably would lean toward no pillow top if given a choice—but are open to one. I'd really like to **address lower-back pain** and the mattress to have **above average edge support**. My wife places importance on **sleeping cool** and **motion isolation**.

Any general thoughts when comparing WinkBeds, Avocado, Brooklyn Bedding, Brentwood Home against one another? *(quality materials, customer service, etc.)*

Have I missed a latex hybrid that's worth considering? Given above, am I wrong to dismiss foam hybrids altogether?

Thanks!"

"Latex Mattress on Floor vs bed frame?. Hey everyone. So, two months ago I bought the Alexander Hybrid Latex Mattress from Nest Bedding ( [https://www.nestbedding.com/products/the-alexander-hybrid-signature-select-mattress](https://www.nestbedding.com/products/the-alexander-hybrid-signature-select-mattress) )

It's alright, but I've found it a little firm and want to return it. I've just had it on the floor. The return stipulations require that I take a picture of my bed frame in order to process a return. That got me wondering, how big of a difference does having a mattress on the floor vs a frame make? Is it possible that a bed frame could fix my issue? Or will the difference be minimal?

I know there are some benefits to cooling when it's on a frame, but not sure about firmness. Thanks for any help you guys can offer

"Choosing mattress comfort layers for Beautyrest rebuild. I was about to go to some mattress stores to try out new mattresses, but then the coronavirus closures hit. Even if they start opening things up again in a month, I'm just not going to feel comfortable going into a mattress store for quite  while, and lying on a bed that other people have been rolling around on. To me, it's not worth the risk.

So for now, I'm thinking about taking apart my 10-year old Simmons Beautyrest Classic tight-top Hutson ""plush firm"" mattress and ordering new comfort layers for it.  The ""plush"" has become mush and the ""firm"" is a distant memory, but my wife and I liked the way it felt when it was new and I'd like to try to be in a similar ballpark with the upgrade.

It looks like most people use a slab of talalay latex to do this. In order to approximate the original comfort and support this particular mattress had, should I be looking at one layer of latex or would it be more effective to stack two thinner layers with increasing densities?  How thick altogether?  

I'll also want a nice, new quilted cover which I think is important to the overall comfort of a mattress. What would be the best way to accomplish this? Lay a self-contained latex topper with its own quilted cover on top of the original pocket spring core, and don't worry about whether it looks 'finished' since it will be covered with a fitted sheet anyway? Or install new layers of bare latex and then put the whole assembly into a new zip-up mattress cover with a quilted tight top?"

"Mattress HELP! Too HOT!!. Hi everyone! This is my first post EVER on Reddit, so hopefully I'll see your replies! I am about to return my 2nd mattress - my main complaint with both is - TOO HOT!! Must be the new foams they are using cuz never had this problem with mattresses before (15+ years ago). The 1st one was at Beautyrest Hybrid Plush - I really liked the feel, but the trapped heat was unbearable. The store took it back and sold me a Sealy Silver Chill for 2K - supposedly with cooling technology. Sure, it's cool to touch where there's no body, but still like a furnace underneath me. Ugh! Been researching latex but it's confusing to know what's what. Is there any quality bed out there that is supportive, well made and sleeps cool/ does not trap heat? Thanks so much for your help!"

I have sheets of wood plywood that are an inch thick and 4 foot by 8 foot and was wondering if I could saw two down to fit the frame. Since it would already have the support of the steel slats I was planning to use a hole saw to drill a bunch of 2 1/2"" holes into it for ventilation. Does this work or is it not advisable?

"Need new bed for parents. So my dad recently had neck surgery, but has had some lower back trouble as well over the last 10-20 years. It’s just brought to the forefront of my mind that I need to get them a good mattress / bed, but I have no idea what I’m looking for. I’m not asking anyone to do the work for me, but I need to know where I can start looking / doing some trustworthy research to figure out what they need. I also think an adjustable bed (angles and such) could help my dad as he can’t even lie in bed with my mom right now because he needs to be up at an angle. I know it’s short term right now, but I think it could be helpful to them long term.

"Mattress Hell w/ MF. Hi guys, i posted a few months ago about my purple 4.  I bought a tempurpedic for $2100 from MF, returned it for the purple 4, now I returned the purple 4 for a 3.  

The purple 4 caved after 2 months and hurt my back like hell.  So I got a 3, and I slept on it last night and woke up in agony.  Too damn soft, I thought it would have actual support but no.

I feel like an asshole bc I obviously need to return this mattress, and this is the 3rd time.  The people at MF have been very accommodating but not helpful when it comes to addressing what i need - i feel like I’ve done adequate research but apparently not?  I thought purple was a good product but I guess not - my back is completely caving in to my chest and killing me.  

But I have no idea what to do - I think purple is BS at this point, unless the 2 has actual support.  My husband has the temper pedic medium hybrid thing that is great, so I think I might get that, it’s just so expensive, like $3800.  

I just need a firmer mattress, is what I am gathering, but I can’t have something that is hurting me when I sleep on my side too, and that’s been my issue in the past with former mattresses.  If anyone has any help to offer I’d appreciate it."
"Not Another Bed in a Box Recommendation Thread!. Hello, 

Making a post here after getting exhausted from sorting through Amazon, we're looking for a new mattress as our old one is 8+ years old and has a large dent in the middle that we fall in to. 

I'm trying to figure out what- if any -seller on Amazon is a good option for getting a memory foam mattress from. From the research I've done, fiberglass inner socks are a no-go, and [I've found a number of retailers that claim to not use them](https://www.jsnowcreations.com/reviews/which-memory-foam-mattresses-do-not-contain-fiberglass/), but of those, I'm struggling to find what matters and if I'm looking at the right variables. Is \~$300 for a queen or full too cheap? If I go any higher, should I consider looking at physical stores instead on online?

Most of the cheaper sellers tout 3"" memory foam layers, does the top layer thickness really matter? Likewise, one of the brands which doesn't use fiberglass has a 1.5"" memory foam layer, what will this do in terms of how firm or conforming the bed is? We like firmer mattresses. 

From what I currently understand, the foam density is going to be the lowest quality (3lbs, maybe 4 if you get lucky), so there's really no changing this. We're not picky at all as far as brands go, we just want to find something that has the typical memory foam ""feel"" (press your hand in and feel a lasting 'dent' for a few seconds), and won't shed glittery fiberglass everywhere after 4 months of use."
"Stomach sleepers thoughts wanted. Howdy - In the market of getting a new mattress for the first time in quite a while. Upgrading from a Full to a King so you can probably tell I’m looking forward to it.

I’m a stomach sleeper and don’t like anything too soft. I’m currently interested in the Purple Mattress and the Luft bed: Firm Sleeper but also open to other brands. Does anybody sleep on one of these, or have a recommendation for a stomach sleeper? 

Thanks!"
"Don’t judge me, I’m buying a new mattress for the first time in 12 years and could use some advice. Hi guys, 

I’m turning 30 later this month and will be buying a mattress for the first time in my adult life soon.  I know, I haven’t been doing my body any favors. 

I would love to stay in the sub $700 range and I find that I sleep on my stomach and my side equally.  What are some brands I need to look into?  I’m a little overwhelmed at the moment.

I’m male, 5’9 and about 175 pounds.  Thanks!"
"Tulo vs the 12 inch Lucid Hybrids?. Does anyone have either of these beds where they can speak to their experience with them? Really need a new bed that I might eventually move to a guest room, but my current mattress is killing me and I’m on a budget."
"2nd night on ingellibed indigo. So guys I have sensitive nerves and I can it is the pain from sitting on a certain way or something. I went through about five beds and out of the five I was on a sleep EZ hybrid latex for about like $1,000 bed in a box it was pretty good but I still would have some issues.

I had the beautyrest Jennings that I hated it was too soft and I was sinking in and I just want to let you guys know mattress firm is one of the biggest scammers in the world dude beautyrest and all these big Brand State they mark up the beds so hard you're getting shite for your money

I had a Serta hybrid performance I thought I liked but it started to give me issues was too soft

I had a beautyrest recharge firm was way too firm and felt like I had like pins of pain all over

I tried a beautyrest pressure smart hated it

and then finally I had the Tempur-Pedic hybrid adapt medium which I sunk in and I felt pins and I was going to die


So this problem is more about my body than the beds but I'm really sensitive so.... but I decided to get the legacy version indigo intellibed cuz I heard a lot of good things about it and when I was in The mattress firm store I tried the purple and it was interesting... from the rumors I heard until the bed was the original and probably contains the intelligent brother the engineer.. so I wanted to give that a try versus the purple


And let me just tell you that I'm only on day 2 you know how but I woke up this morning I really felt refreshed intellibed indigo is soft and hard at the same time it's really nice it's almost like you're sleeping on a cloud

I would advise against the mattress firm collaboration of intellivend because it's like a marketing scheme they have like a new mattress firm collaboration and they're like $8,000 for a bed

Just go with the legacy let me know if you have any questions"
"Seeking Medium-Firm mattress in $500-$1000 range.. My girlfriend and I are in the market for a new foam or hybrid queen mattress. We are both stomach/side sleepers and our current spring mattress is getting painful.

"I have never bought a mattress before.. As the title says, I have never had to buy a mattress because my parents always took care of it for me.

I just recently got married and we have been using my old queen mattress but if we are being honest I am like the princess and the pea. One wrong thing in the mattress is going to throw my through a loop and I won't be able to sleep. It has come to that with this mattress as I have had it for a very long time.

My husband and I are looking into getting a king mattress because we have 3 dogs. I have been reading and trying to research what is best but frankly it is causing me to be overwhelming due to the fact I feel like it is nothing but ads and I am just lost. I would like to get a hybrid mattress (coils and memory foam) that is medium, I think? Plush seems too soft and firm seems way too hard.

Are there any suggestions or tips you can give us? We would like to stay in the budget of 800-1300 for just the mattress top. We have a platform king bed frame so we should not need the box spring. 

PS I am a stomach sleeper and he is a back sleeper.

Thank you all!"
"Who has tried latex mattress toppers?. I bought a super firm mattress with the plan to change out toppers instead of the mattress itself. I would love to buy a latex topper but I've heard they can be smelly. Does anyone have any experience with them? Any recommendations? For context, I am a 140lb side sleeper who sometimes wakes up with should pain. I don't have a garage or yard to air out a topper if it is smelly for a long time."
"Alternatives to buying a completely new mattress. hey all. 
so i like super soft mattresses. a few months ago, i went mattress shopping and did the thing where you lay on them in the store. i found one that seemed to be somewhat soft. the very soft ones were like $800. this one was $600 so i settled. i’m able to sleep on it okay (it’s not the best but it seemed fine) but i’m waking up every morning and throughout the night with my arms numb and tingling! i was staying with family over the last few weeks and it confirmed my arm numbness is my mattress because it didn’t happen once there. now i’m back home and last night it happened again. i think my mattress is too firm maybe. but i spent $600 on this and she won’t let me exchange it now since it’s been months. is there anyone who can suggest a really good topper? that might fix this problem? i’d rather spend $100-$200 on a topper than like $800 on a new mattress"
"Firm Mattress With Decent Trial Period. Hi mattress people, I'd love to get your thoughts on mattresses.

I am looking for a king firm Mattress in the time of Covid.  It's unfortunate that i can't test things out now but I can't really wait until Covid is over as I recently moved and have a bed coming - my existing bed is going into a second bedroom.

I am a stomach sleeper and heavy (260lbs pre covid, don't care to check now that daily workouts have stopped for 2+ weeks!).  My wife doesn't care about mattresses so it's all about me!

I like a mattress firm because it's very painful/ somewhat crippling to my lower back when wake up after sinking into something plush.

Is there anything internet order I can get while all the stores are closed?  Ideally it would have a nice long return policy so I can get rid of it if it doesn't work, but I also read that many mattresses get softer over time so I want to minimize that obviously.  

All thoughts are welcome."
"Mattress for someone that prefers sleeping on the floor?. I've always had problems with insomnia and beds, from my cheap Sealy mattress I had growing up to more premium mattresses like Duxiana's I tried while sleeping at hotels.

When I first moved in to my new place, out of desperation I placed a down comforter on the tile floor, and low and behold I slept like a baby. For the past few months I have been sleeping on the floor, and while I won't call it ""comfy"" I sleep very well, my posture feeling very natural and aligned. When I wake up I feel fresh, and don't have the urge to laze about.

Now I'm starting to date again, so as you might imagine this would come across as really weird if I have no bed. I would like a mattress or mattress-alternative that's similar in feel to my floor setup that won't make me look like Norman Bates."
"Need a Mattress, Covid-19 screwed it up, so I need opinions. Hi everyone, I was in the early stages of shopping for a mattress when everything shut down, so I am not sure what is ideal at this point. From the stores I had gone to it seemed that a hybrid was best for me, in terms of comfort. I am looking for a twin. I am about 5 10 and around 265 lbs, with that number going down. I have looked at the different resources on this subreddit and they have been helpful, however, I wanted to see what you all thought of the Helix Midnight Luxe? Also, if you have suggestions in that price range, I would more than appreciate them."
"Canadian Mattress without memory foam or latex top layer. Hi there!

I've tried 3 different mattresses over the past year - two bed-in-a-box (Silk+Snow, and a Bear Hybrid), and one locally made 100% Talalay Latex mattress. They all retain too much heat in their top layer for me, so I'm looking to find something very breathable on that top layer (and not just adding a topper). 

When I've tried laying on micro-coils in stores, that was always my favourite; but it's hard to get out to stores these days and try  for obvious reasons haha. (stay home! plz don't get others sick) Are there any recommended pocket + micro-coil mattresses? (preferably from small/indie retailers, but can bow to bigger places like sleep country if needed)

Any feelings on wool mattresses, such as the ones at [Black Sheep mattress](https://blacksheepmattress.com/)?

"Purple Premiere 3 or 4?. Hi guys, wondering if you can please help me decide between a Purple hybrid 3 or 4.  
I'm 5'0"" 135lbs (currently 175.. pregnant...) and my husband is not a big dude, he's 5'8"" and 165lbs.

  
I have the original, got it about 3 years ago directly from Purple. For the first two years it was great. I slept on my stomach and back. It was never comfortable to sleep on my side.

Now that I'm pregnant I've been sleeping on my side for about 7 months now and it's hell. I toss and turn and wake up in the middle of the night feeling like my hips are on fire.

I am probably going to upgrade to the hybrid premier, I just don't know if I should get the 3"" or the 4"" grid. My husband doesn't care either way.

Thanks!"
"Ritz Carlton Stearns And Foster Mattress Review. I'm posting this because I couldn't find any reviews out there on this particular mattress when we were looking.

My wife travels a lot for work, and as such she has a lot of Marriott points. One of the perks they give you every so often is the option to buy the same mattress used in various Marriott properties at a significant discount. Each property uses different mattress types. Our mattress was 9 years old and in need of replacement (causing a lot of back aches for my wife) so we started looking around.

Although we have never stayed at a Ritz, the fact that they use Stearns and Foster was interesting to us. We prefer the traditional mattress feel that Stearns has to the memory foam or other feels that have become more common. Supposedly this mattress is specially made just for the Ritz, and so there's limited information available on it. We went to a local mattress store to try out a bunch of mattress types and get an idea of what we might like.

In the end we decided we did want a Stearns and Foster mattress. My wife likes a firm mattress and I like a softer mattress, but she agreed that a softer mattress (we liked the Lux Estate Cassette Plush) would be acceptable for her. We were about to buy that one, but then saw various reviews indicating that the pillow tops on them tended to wear out quicker making the mattress uncomfortable. Supposedly the secret is that the Ritz (and other hotels) will do layers on top of the mattress to bring down the firmness some and make the base mattress last longer, while replacing the various toppers. At least that's what we got out of it.

The Ritz mattress doesn't list a firmness, but was listed at 13.5"" tall, which is in line with the firm/extra firm other Stearns and Foster mattresses. So the math made sense - this will be firm, and we'll need to play with toppers to get what we like.

So we decided to take a chance on the Ritz mattress. Upon calling we found out that the Ritz also uses two other kinds of mattresses, so they asked which Ritz we'd stayed at to match the mattress with our experience. We said we hadn't stayed at a Ritz, but wanted the Stearns and Foster mattress. This took about 4-5 weeks to arrive (they advertised 5-6 weeks when we ordered). We've now had it about a month or so (showed up just before quarantine started to take effect). We also bought the box springs.

The mattress itself is attractive and looks and feels like a high end mattress similar to the other Stearns and Foster mattresses. It has the traditional mattress feel we were looking for. It is definitely a firm/extra firm mattress. My wife likes it as is, but sleeping on it without a topper causes me body aches. We expected going in we would need to experiment with toppers.

Right now we are still in the experimentation phase, and we are also realizing that my wife and I will ultimately have different solutions on her side vs. mine. This is a benefit of the firm mattress with different sleep preferences - we can tailor each side to our likes (we have a King). Right now I've found a solution that works great for me (three layers of a feather bed topper - I'm apparently the princess from ""The Princess and the Pea"") and my wife likes the mattress by itself just fine with the cover we have on top of it. She doesn't like the feather topper at all. However that creates a significant ridge in the middle of the bed that we'd rather not have. So we'll experiment more to see if we can find something that will work for both of us. I'm not going to list brands of what we're using specifically for pads/toppers at this point just since we haven't finalized the solution.

Summary: If you have the Marriott discount, this can get you a Stearns mattress for a significantly lower price than what you'll find in a store, enough to make up for what you spend on toppers to tune it to exactly what you want. If you want a firm or extra firm mattress anyway and like the traditional mattress feel, then this is a no brainer. If you don't get the discount and are paying the list price, it probably doesn't make sense to buy this mattress. I think long term this will allow us to be happy with our mattress for longer since we can replace the toppers as they wear out over time and, once we get it tuned, will be a good thing."

Pocket spring vs coir mattress which should I buy? I have back pain and muscle strain issue.. 
"Twin XL bed recommendation. I am getting really confused with all the options out there. 

Due to my current living situation and space, I need a twin XL mattress. For the record, I am at least 6' and over 300lb. I am a big dude, which doesn't help. 

All my research is leaning towards a hybrid mattress because it might be able to hold up to my weight more than all foam (correct?). My budget is $500 or less (sadly) also need a base. My state is also under lockdown till early May, so all my mattress store are closed. I am currently sleeping on a very lumpy, painful cotton based futon mattress that causes considerable pain and at times, loss of work due to it. I can not wait any longer. 

I am a combo sleeper on my current sleeping situation. And when I did get to do some in-store shopping. I learned I tend to like a medium feel with a little bit of sink (though harder at first that breaks down to softer in time is fine).  If I can get a year or two out of this mattress, especially in the lower end, I would be happy. 

The ones I am looking at are:

"Best mattresses currently at Costco?. I have been looking for a mattress for a long time, and have decided to get whatever I get from costco just to make life easier as far as returns and whatnot. I have read (probably too much) about the differences in quality between a Kirkland variety vs the same thing from a storefront. That being said, theres gotta be *something* that costco sells that is good? I have been looking at their new Stearns & Foster Lakeridge Queen, the Beautyrest Silver Hybrid Salina Plush, and even some of their foam options such as Novaform.

My budget is around $1,000 for a mattress, I can't really go much higher unless theres a groundbreaking difference thats well worth it."
Extra firm mattress topper?. I finally got a bed! Trouble is it’s a bit too soft on the surface. I had thought it was okay cause it seems really firm just below the initial padding but no. It’s causing so much back pain. I’m thinking my only option is a very firm mattress topper. The place doesn’t do returns or exchanges due to the virus. Specific recommendations of extra firm mattress toppers would be super appreciated! It’s been a few nights of waking up to take extra strength Tylenol and hoping to fall back asleep.
"need recommendations!!! UK side sleeper, 160lbs. Hey,

I know that I should try it in store first but I can't right now, because of COVID and  I have somebody that is buying for me and won't let me buy a temp solution.

"Simmons 8"" Memory Foam bed. Hey all, I wanted to get reviews from you guys about Simmoms 8"" memory foam mattress. Costco is selling these for a very cheap price. $210 for a full mattress.

Is it an overall good mattress for what you are paying?"
"Pocketed Coil/Latex Hybrid Mattress Options. I think I have settled on what type of mattress construction I want to try out but due to COVID-19 I don't really have the option of going to a store and laying on one. The nearest store to me that would have mattresses like this unfortunately is over an hour away so it would be difficult even without COVID-19.

As you can tell from the title I am interested in Pocketed Coil/Latex Hybrids but I am hoping to buy from somewhere that has a return policy that involves donating to a local charity and not dumping in a landfill. I haven't tried a mattress like this before and it would be nice to have the peace of mind of knowing if I need to return I am not sending it straight to a landfill.

I am mostly a back sleeper but spend some time on my side. The main two options I have considered are My Green Mattress Natural Escape and the Avocado Green Mattress. Leaning My Green Mattress mostly due to price as the Avocado is almost 1800 if you add the pillow top and the My Green Mattress I have read is slightly less firm which I thought would be better for my occasional side sleeping tendencies.

Are there any other obvious options I should be considering? Are the options I am considering high quality mattresses? Would the price premium for Avocado be worth it in the long run?"

This will be my first time buying a mattress (currently using the one I’ve grown up on) and need some advice on where to start. 

I am on a budget and would prefer not to spend an excessive amount, but I also understand being too cheap will cause me to have to buy a new one in a few years. 

I prefer a firmer mattress, but I’m also a side sleeper. I’ve been reading around on here and it sounds like memory foam is good for side sleepers. Is there a such thing as firm memory foam?

Also, because of the pandemic, I obviously can’t go to a store to test it out. So something that has a good return policy.

"Bought Purple 2 ""returned"" mattress for Cheap... anyone else?. Just scored a Purple 2 King for $750 off of Facebook marketplace.  Apperantly these are mattresses that the folks return during the sleep trial, seems like Purple just calls places like Got Junk or others to pick up for free.  These guys are flipping them on FB and pretty neat deals.  However you buy at the risk of not adjusting to the mattress.  Nonetheless, the manufactured date on the tag says March 28,2020.  So about a month old, smells and looks new, going to give her a whirl tonight.

$750 is a steal considering with tax it might cost about $2100k on site.

Also I am thinking when buying off of these mattress in a box sites, they ""price-in"" other peoples returns into your cost.  So essentially your paying $2k because its offsetting the tossed mattresses by others.

Anyone else buy one this way?"

"Best place to buy toppers from with a return policy?. I'm a 27 year old male, 180 lbs, side sleeper.

I'm 7 weeks into sleeping on my 'new' mattress and the shoulder pain/arm numbness hasn't subsided. Its a latex hybrid named the 'Hotel Luxury Firm' from Oregon Mattress Company. It felt awesome the three times (yes 3!) I demoed it in the store for 30 minutes a piece. Turns out I was wrong. With how much time I wasted trying every mattress in town, this definitely makes me a bit mad lol.

The first 3 weeks were miserable with neck and shoulder pain. I bought a new high loft pillow which helped a ton but it hasn't alleviated all my symptoms. I still wake up every day with stiff shoulders and numb arms. I'd do a comfort exchange at this point if there was not a 10% restocking fee and no refund of the difference in price of the new mattress from the place I bought it from. I have another 5 weeks to take advantage of that if needed, but I'd like to avoid it.

Obviously the mattress is too firm and I need a topper to try out. The bed is already 15 inches thick (which is insane), so I'm probably looking at a 17 inch mattress when I add a 2 inch topper to it. I'm leaning towards not trying a memory foam topper. I'd been doing some research this morning and not finding a ton of places that offer returns on toppers. I'd rather not be potentially out another $150 or whatever if the topper doesn't work out and I still end up having to do the comfort exchange. Where is everyone else getting their toppers at?"
"Mattress in a box Canada help!. I have been researching for a few days and am beyond confused! 

What I am looking for:

King size memory foam mattress (not because I particularly want memory foam but can't fit a traditional king in house, and afraid if I get a hybrid in box that doesn't work I won't be able to get it back out!)

Two people - one side and one back sleeper both in the 215-225lbs range (plus dog + baby which is why king is needed)

Budget max $1200

First choice right now is Silk and Snow I think, which is lower end of budget. Would prefer to try Logan and Cove medium plush but scared of not fitting mattress back out.

I used to use thin foam mattresses from IKEA and when I lived in Japan I used Japanese style futons (maybe one or two inch thick bedroll on the floor) so I am looking for something like that.

I might just get some plywood to put on top of the slats in my bed and find some foam topper to stick on top but I was wondering if anyone else has researched this.

I find that hard surfaces let my body find the right position by itself while cushioning lets it sag into bad positions."
"Help!! What kind of mattress to get? (Newbie 23yo). My current twin bed Ive had for quite a few years & it would be great bed for someone who didn't have so many exoskeleton issues like myself. It seems to be adding to my already head to toe pain as the years to by unfortunately. I haven't had the chance to try any out on stores because of the virus. I sleep all ways on my back, both sides and my stomach. 

Im hyper mobile and was born was a clubbed foot. Because of my foot there's a length discrepancy in my legs and foot size. Issues have been created because of the discrepancy in length so it causes my hips to unaligned, sometimes pushing on my sciatic nerves causing them to act up. Also because discrepancy I have non structural scoliosis throughout my spine, most predominantly from the bottom of the scapula area to the top of my neck. My vertebraes also choose to shift out of place on their own. Sometimes they'll push on nerves creating a pinching n tingly sensation through my back. Also my scapulas tend to rotated out of place, not dislocate but rotated."

"What is the best mattress?. Hi there.

I've recently been struggling with choosing a mattress. My sight's set on the Nectar, Emma and Simba mattresses, but each review says something different about all three. What are your personal experiences with the mattresses? Which one felt the best to you?"
"In my 30's and looking to buy my first mattress ever, could use some advice!. In the coming weeks I'm going to need to purchase a new mattress, and having never bought one before I'm not sure how do shop smartly.  Here's all the details I can think of that might be relevant so maybe someone here could give me some tips or suggestions:


-Needs to be Queen size

-I'm about 165lbs, prefer to sleep on my side

-One current mattress is a super old (25-30+ years) spring mattress that would stab you in the back, has a thick but not very dense foam topper on it.  Feels super comfortable to lie down on or fall asleep on, even on my back, but wake up with extreme back pain and don't sleep well.

-Other current mattress is also old (15-20+ years) but higher quality springs with a nice plush top.  Overall it is better but still causes lower back pain when waking up.

-Would prefer something around $500, but if it makes a huge difference in terms of quality of sleep/back pain I could budget up to $1000.


I tried doing a bit of research online.  The only thing that caught my eye so far was a Nectar memory foam mattress for $800 because I read medium-firm memory foam is generally good for back pain and their warranty/return policy looks very good.  


So, I'm open to tips or suggestions, and thanks in advance."

"Local Mattress Companies South of Boston?. Hi All, anyone from around this area that can suggest some good local companies to buy from? We probably won't realistically start searching until whenever everything calms down with Covid-19, but figured we'd start compiling a list. Prior to everything hit the fan, we tried a few mattress at Mattress Firm and Jordan's, we liked the feel of the Beautyrest Legend Luxury Firm King at Mattress Firm and whatever the Platinum Luxury firm at Jordan's was, from my understanding there are just numerous name for the same mattresses at Beautyrest and the only difference I could see from the Legend and the Platinum was a small bit of Latex foam. At first we felt pretty good about them, but from what I've been reading, there seem to be some quality issues that people have a year into owning the mattress, and for the price of a King for either of those mattresses, seems like I'd want something a bit more reliable. 

&#x200B;

Has anyone gotten a bed from Boston Bed Company? Are they any good? From what I see their prices are pretty decent and they're at least transparent about the density of foam they use.

Another company that seems to get a good reviews is Gardner Mattress, which is only about 20-30 minutes away from us.

Just seeing if there are any other local options, we'd thought about online companies, but we'd both prefer laying on something versus shooting in the dark online and going through the return process if it doesn't work out, plus it'd be nice to support local businesses."
"Review: Bear Hybrid. Hi there!

I've had the Bear Hybrid for about 2.5 months (mid-February 2020). Since I always appreciated reading reviews of a mattress I was interested in while researching, figured I'd take some time and do the same for those who may currently be in the same boat! FWIW I am not a professional mattress reviewer, I'm just a regular guy in Western Canada! Also, for context, I'm 5'11"" (182cm), \~74kg (\~160 pounds), and a side sleeper 95% of the time.

**Back story which led to the Bear!**

Please feel free to skip this section if you just want info on the Bear, but for further context, I had gone through two mattresses which really weren't a good fit for me. The first was a Silk+Snow, which was my very first memory foam (lived with standard ol' innersprings all my life). It was very comfortable, but oh my god it slept SO hot. I couldn't make it through a single night without waking up at least a few times due to overheating, so it was returned within a few months.

My next was a 100% talalay latex mattress from a local manufacturer ([this one specifically](https://fawcettmattress.com/product/model-nine/)). I was happy to support a local business, and also wanted to try latex since I'd heard it was great for those who sleep hot! It was really a neat mattress, the bottom/base layer was a medium-firm, and the top layer was medium - so it was the perfect comfort level for me. However... It also became too warm for me. Granted, it took a lot longer - where the S+S would be too warm within about 45 mins, it took about 3 hours for the heat to really get absorbed into the latex; but it eventually happened. I stuck with it for 89 days, and after much hemming and hawing, begrudgingly returned it. The thing which swung me to return it was ultimately its expense - if I was going to be spending that much on a mattress, it felt like there shouldn't really need compromises to justify it.

This led to a new search. Recognizing that I both sleep hot and have a high sensitivity to heat. I started with a relatively large list, and culled it down to three options:

\- The Bear Hybrid

\- Winkbed

\- Purple Hybrid 3

Winkbeds was actually my #1 choice; but both it and the Purple Hybrid 3 do not deliver to Canada... So I was left with just the one option. So after a delay (that story will be at the end), I finally had the Bear Hybrid - so how did it go?

**The Bear Hybrid Review**

For those who skipped the above preamble, here's a tl;dr:

*I'm a 5'11""/182cm, 74kg/160ish pound side sleepin' guy who sleeps hot and also has a high sensitivity to heat, so a cool mattress which is good for side sleepers was my #1 priority.*

Cool, caught up!

The mattress arrived in a very well packed, quite heavy box. Seriously, the thing is around 110 pounds (around 50kg). That is around the same weight as my old talalay mattress, and that thing was *heavy*. I would very much suggest moving the box around with a dolly, and setting it up with a second person if possible.

Once it has fully expanded, it is quite tall - about 14"" - so if you have a box spring, it might take a stepladder to get into depending on your relative height. I'm on a slatted base, so the height was actually nice to just fall into for me. I have it under a waterproof cotton mattress protector, and bamboo sheets; but the naked mattress is covered with its tencel cover, which is very soft and cool to the touch.

Laying on the mattress, it is quite comfortable. On a firmness scale, I'd place it around 6/10 - so more medium than medium-firm. It has a decent amount of bounce due to the springs, but not excessively so. The motion isolation seems adequate, but I never really checked it and am currently living on my own (my partner lives an ocean away right now), so it never came up. Edge support is generally good on the sides, though it's quite squishy at the foot of the bed, so you might slip off if you sit down at the foot to put your socks on.

Now, the most important part (to me) - the cooling. How does it stack up? Does that cool-to-the-touch tencel feel persist all night? Is it breathable with all of those springs that take up so much of that 14"" height?

>!It isn't very good. !<

I have to say that I'm super disappointed in its temperature regulation. All the reviews I read made a big point about how it is *amazing* for its cooling, and how its heat retention is *second-to-none*; but my experience is that it's as bad, if not worse, than the previous mattresses I mentioned above. This is especially surprising given the fact that *so much* area below the comfort layer is taken up by air; but yet it doesn't feel breathable at all.

For example, as an experiment, if I lay on the same spot for 30 mins with a blanket on top of me (even a very thin one), the blanket will not be particularly warm, but the area below me will match my body temperature. If I then move to another side of the bed, it will be as cool as the original spot I started in. If I then do the same process again (laying there for 30 mins with a thin blanket), same result. The thing is, if I then put my hand on the original area (still under the cover) it is *still warm*. This is what shows me it is not breathable, and makes me question why it needs to be a hybrid at all.

I mean, of course, the springs do help with posture and ergonomics for having it support you in all of the right places; but the primary reason I opted for springs was for breathability, so I have to say that I'm pretty thoroughly disappointed in the Bear Hybrid. It should be noted that I've tried it with a big range of covers, sheets, and blankets over the past few months - even with the bare minimum (literally just a top sheet on me), if I'm wearing a shirt, the thing still overheats me. I have started the return process as of this morning.

**In short, I think it is a good mattress overall; but if cooling/temperature neutrality is your priority, I cannot recommend it. Please feel free to AMA, I'd be happy to try and answer any questions.**

My journey is beginning anew, and I have to admit, I'm not looking forward to it... If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them! My current plan is to stay away from comfort layers with either memory foam or latex, so perhaps an innerspring with a fiber/wool-based comfort layer.

**Another review regarding Bear itself**

This is the end of the review of the mattress; but there's something else to talk about. I have been debating whether or not to bring it up at all since it is entirely possible that my experience could have been a total one-off glitch, and maybe wouldn't impact anyone else; but I had a particularly bad experience with Bear as a company which I thought may be worth sharing.

Firstly, before diving into negativity, I wanted to say this: Every customer service and support representative I have been in touch with at Bear has been courteous, kind, patient, and very helpful. I want to give them the highest praise, and thank them for all the time they spent with me! I do take umbrage with some aspects of Bear's management, however.

I mentioned getting the Bear Hybrid around mid-February; but I actually ordered it near the start of January, and it was supposed to arrive a few weeks later. I actually had shipping updates texted to me as I would need to come home from the office in order to receive the package (ahh, to live in the before-times again...), and in mid/late Jan, had an update about it being out for delivery in my city. I worked from home that day, and when it hadn't arrived by the end of the day, I checked the tracking. The tracking page now read that the mattress was being [returned to sender by request of the vendor](https://i.imgur.com/wS3ijNQ.png).

This was very confusing. I never received any emails from Bear regarding this, and it was especially surprising given that it had already gone out for delivery. As it was 7pm, I waited until the next business day to contact them.

The support agents I chatted with didn't have much information other than it was cancelled by the billing department - they said they'd ask them and get back to me ASAP. I didn't hear back for a day or two, so I called back and was able to get in touch with a manager with the support department.

I was told that my order was cancelled due to it being flagged as fraudulent. My immediate reaction was to login to my bank account to make sure my card hadn't been compromised, but thankfully there were no errant charges there. When I asked further, they said that they'd received a complaint from another customer whose card had been charged with the value of my order. The explanation they gave was that it was possible that I had entered the wrong credit card number during checkout, and that we could get another order on the go.

I brought up that this wasn't possible due to how I entered my CC number, and the manager reiterated that it was a mistake on my part and that it was my responsibility to rectify it. The way it was communicated was very black-and-white and left no room for interpretation that it was my fault, not Bear's. I thanked the manager for their time, and stewed in this for a while.

What they said is impossible for two reasons:

1. The reason I brought up on the phone - I store my CC info in a secured password manager (1password) and use the exact same system for all of my online purchases, so given that I've been using this system for years without issue, I'm certain my credit card info was 100% correct.
2. I am a software developer in finance, and know that entering a wrong CC number would not simply charge someone else. Even if the CC number entered was one number off, that number needs to be validated against both the expiry date and CVV numbers (not to mention name on card and billing address in a good system). The way these numbers are encoded means that if any part is entered incorrectly (even by one number), the whole transaction will be invalidated - so it is functionally impossible for this to have been the case, even if I'd entered it manually.

Another factor which bugged me was that they had received this complaint from someone who was already/previously a Bear customer. By black boxing this (looking at a closed system from the outside), my assumption is that their payment gateway/system (which should be automated) is either flawed, or they are doing it manually, which is prone to mistakes. They placed the blame on the customer, and that is wrong both for me, and the person who got incorrectly charged.

I still wanted to try the Bear, so I opted to use a prepaid mastercard which I loaded with the appropriate amount (but did not cancel in the event of a return/refund - which ended up being the right move it seems).

Again, I don't want this to reflect poorly on any individual support or customer service agent, but the experience with that manager made me question Bear's integrity as a secured system, as well as having left a sour taste in my mouth given the condescending nature of the manager's reply."

"Purple Sheets Alternative. I have had a purple mattress for almost a year now and absolutely love it, but sheets have been a different matter. We bought some relatively cheap sheets to go with the mattress when we first bought it because we didn't think we would need or care for purple sheets, but after about a month we hated how often the sheets would come off the sides of the bed and how much they would bunch up. We decided to buy purple sheets and we love how well they compliment the mattress but I have never been a fan of the knit t-shirt type material they are made of. Even though they're great sheets, I'm wondering if anyone else has found a different brand with the more traditional woven fabric that also works relatively well with the mattress (as in doesn't come off at the corners, doesn't bunch up every night after regular shifting/turning)?"
"OG Tempurpedic...any comparables now?. Back when we were younger, our parents invested in tempurpedic mattresses for the whole family. These were gloriously dense and comfortable mattresses.  



I have heard that ""they don't make em like they used to"" anymore, with the ""good stuff"" shrinking drastically and even that the old foam is not even in the new mattresses. 



I've laid on a few in-store of the recent mattresses and while they do seem decent, they didn't quite have the feel of the old ones.




So my question is....is there any one who produces anything like the good OG tempurpedic mattresses? Is there a way to emulate them? Or am I going to have to pull a heist on my parents the next thanksgiving?"

"In urgent need of help for choosing a mattress in Canada for a heavyweight. Hi [r/mattress](https://www.reddit.com/r/mattress/)!

I need some help with buying a new mattress as I am feeling a bit overwhelmed by the different choices out there and so far in my research none of them seem to be a perfect fit for me except for mattresses made in the USA that I can't buy here.

I am a 5'11'' 280 lbs male.

I currently own a cheap Novaform 100% Polyfoam bed from Costco that I bought in 2014 which has been causing me bad back, neck and shoulder pain for several years now. I am at a point where I am desperate to buy a new mattress. Needless to say my first foam mattress experience has been terrible but I know that you get what you pay for and that technology has improved significantly so I am open to trying another better one. I also had a innerspring bed before that that was OK. Basically, I am open to just about any type (Pocketed coils, springs, foam, latex, hybrids).

I always have had cheap beds. I am willing to try something more expensive this time around, although my budget would ideally be below 2000$ CAD. I am OK with spending a bit more if it is really worth it.

I almost exclusively sleep on my side but I also pass allot of time on my back watching TV at night before going to bed or sometimes even the whole day on lazy days on the weekend.

I would say I tend to prefer a softer feeling bed although I need something with nice support. Alleviating pressure points and helping with my back and shoulder pains is a must. I usually dislike firmer beds although I might get used to it and love it after some time, hard to say, as I always had softer more plush beds.

Motion isolation is not a priority.

Heat dissipation is not a big factor for me although I would prefer something on the cooler side.

I want to eventually put the mattress on an adjustable bed, so it would need to be a good fit for that.

Obviously it must be something available for purchase in Canada, and it would be a big plus to be able to have it delivered to my home.

I am desperately in need for some advice as the pain and lack of comfort is getting to be unbearable and I never seem to be able to get a good night sleep.

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give."
"Copper infused memory foam vs. Gel infused memory foam..

"They said buying a Tempur Pedic would be a great idea -.-. I have problems with my lower back and shoulders. So I bought a firm Tempur Pedic. 

First night and I've noticed my lower back getting f\*\*d. I've been sleeping on it for 20 days now and I can say I don't like this bed. My lower back hurts more. And it's not doing any good for my shoulders either. I notice my shoulders don't really get absorbed in the mattress and it feels too hard on it.  

I bought this bed at an official Tempur Pedic store. I gotta say I got ripped off. I bought a showroom model and the 90 days trial rule don't apply for a showroom model so I'm stuck with this bed without being able to change the mattress either. 

I thought I had a great deal. They said the official price for this bed was around 6k but I got it for around 3k because it was a showroom model. Later I found out on the website that a new bed is only a few hundred euro's more. This 6k they said was BS. 

My question is since I'm stuck with this damn bed. Can I put a new topper on top of this mattress? If so any recommendations pls?"
"Help! Very firm, affordable, non-memory-foam mattress that can be ordered online. This post is yet another cry for help!

My grandmother is in desperate need of a new mattress. Her requirements are that it be a) $500 or less and b) most importantly, very firm. She hates memory foam. It's okay if the mattress doesn't last forever! She just needs something that will be comfortable for now.

I think she'd be very happy with a simple Ikea mattress, but unfortunately their wait-time for delivery is almost a month, and we can't afford to wait that long. Obviously she'd much rather go try something out in a store, but that's impossible given the pandemic.

I have spent all day reading reviews and trying to figure out what to order for her, and like so many other people have posted on here, I feel more confused than ever. I'm considering a Tulo Firm, but worried that she'll hate the memory foam feel of it. Also have considered a Tuft & Needle Original, but worried that it will be too soft.

https://www.amazon.com/Zinus-SmartBase-Foundation-Replacement-Noise-Free/dp/B00GXUM0M2/ref=mp_s_a_1_16?dchild=1&keywords=zinus%2Bplatform%2Bbed&qid=1588267757&sr=8-16&th=1&psc=1) and I love it, but I was wondering if it was appropriate support for the mattress? The warranty states “Tempur-Pedic® mattresses have been designed to be paired with a Tempur-Pedic® foundation. However, we understand that some consumers wish to use their slatted foundation or platform bed which may be permissible provided the slats and bed are structurally sound and as a general rule 3” wide and no more than 4” apart.” It seems like the wording leaves them wiggle room to void a warranty if you don’t buy one of their expensive foundations. I’m not so concerned about that because I have a floor model which means my warranty is only a 5 year one through the store that I bought it at. I’m more worried about actual impact of longevity of the mattress. Is the platform I have good enough? Should I buy a bunkie board to put under it? Solid or slatted? (I’ve read about the potential for mold growth with solid foundations). Or should I just bite the bullet and buy one of their $300 foundations?"
"Need help deciding between a few beds for heavier individuals. Hi,

I'm 5'11 280 lbs (it varies...) , wide shoulders.

I am mostly a side sleeper but also a back sleeper (I would say 70/30).

I sleep alone.

I usually prefer softer feelings beds but I need support. I would rather it be a cool mattress but it isn't a big deal if it's not. Not a fan of all foam, looking for more of a hybrid feel but could go with anything really.

I have been looking at several beds and would like your input on them and if you think they are quality or a good fit for me. If you have your own suggestions or need more info feel free to ask.

Here are the beds I had my eye on : 

\- Winkbeds Medium Firm

\- Winkbeds Plus

\- Helix +

\- Purple Hybrid 3

\- Nest Bedding Alexander Signature Hybrid (Medium or luxury firm)

&#x200B;

I want to pull the trigger pretty soon since my current bed is causing me lots of back pain because it provides no support at all.

Thank you for any help provided!"
"Deciding between Avocado and Winkbed | Need help with Foundation | And topper?. Hi r/ Mattress

Hope everyone here is doing  well!

I began my mattress journey a while back... in the beginning I was going to research the crap out of mattresses... but after a while I decided I was going to buy either the Avocado or the Winkbed. LOL. I currently sleep on a cheap mattress from God knows when. I plan to move out from where I currently live (with family members) and before I do that I'm going to buy a bed. I'm looking for something that sleeps cool, is firm, does not sag, and yet has a soft 'top'... the way I'm envisioning is, the top is soft enough for me to sink into it a little... up until a point where it becomes firm.

&#x200B;

For info I'm 6'2"", 238lbs. I'm a side/stomach sleeper... I rarely sleep on my back (mainly because every bed I've slept on throughout my life has sucked, something I realized as I began to research mattresses) EDIT: I'm buying a King size.

&#x200B;

I had a few questions:

\- I'm leaning towards the Avocado. I keep hearing it's better to get it without the pillow top, and to get a topper from somewhere else (or just directly from Avocado). Would this be a good idea? It looks like without the pillow top the bed is very firm.

\- When it comes to foundations, do you guys have any suggestion? I'm thinking of buying the foundation on the Avocado website, or the one on the Winkbed site (if I change my mind and go with the Wink) just to make it easier. Would that be a good idea or are there cheaper/better ones out there? Also, I need something that I can bring up to a second floor through a tight set of stairs. I currently have a split boxspring and I've been told by the owner of the house ""to get something like that"". I'm guessing though that any foundation would work since it comes disassembled?

\- Regarding toppers. I've heard that it's better to get the Avocado without the pillow top and then get a topper from somewhere else. Any suggestions here? Maybe the Avocado topper (not pillow top), or is that too expensive?

\- Can a topper be added to the Winkbed?

\- For those who have either the Avocado or the Winkbed, just how firm is it really? For the Winkbed I'm leaning towards the firmer option.

&#x200B;

Thanks for your input! (PS. if anyone has mattress cover insight, that'd be great too! Otherwise I'll probably just go with what is on the website of whatever mattress I end up buying)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Oh, yeah! Forgot to mention, would love that whatever foundation I buy will work for any King sized mattress. SO if I get the Avocado Foundation and decide to return the mattress, I'd like it still work with any other King size mattress that I could buy. I assume that will be the case but just want to make sure."

My fiancé and I are looking for a mattress topper, but it seems like right now it’s pretty difficult to try any of these out with the current conditions. I’ve done my research and narrowed it down to these three. 

We are looking for a topper that isn’t necessarily super soft/plush, but one that is soft but still providing good support without being firm. We are hoping it will last up to 5 years too! I sleep on my stomach/side and she sleeps on her side!

If you all have advice on any of these that would be amazing!

"Tempur-Cloud with Nectar Foundation?. 
I purchased a Tempur-Cloud and have it on the foundation from Nectar as it was a really good deal. The slats are 3 inches wide and 4 inches apart, which should be in warranty specs (I think). Would there be any extra benefit to buying the Tempur 2in foundation to use as well?"

The spark are quick and very bright lasting like only 2 seconds, but I don’t feel anything when it comes to contact with me. This thing has been driving me insane and I don’t know how to make it stop. The sound is much louder than you would think as well.

"Well, i think i found out why my bed sleeps so hot.. https://i.imgur.com/xH8ikBe.png

This bed is a 15 year old Simons Beautyrest. I've had it for about 11 months now and it sleeps incredibly hot, enough to keep me awake all night. After getting fed up with it, i decided to take a knife to it and see what the deal was. Turns out it's several layers of this kind of foam, about 4 or 5 inches thick, then some inner springs, which aren't exactly well ventilated. 

I have a few beds in mind to replace this when i get the money (top pics at the moment are Purple and Winkbed). But thanks to this whole Corona Virus thing, all the jobs i applied for are temporarily closed, and it looks like they won't be back open until late may or june. 

Anyway, is there a way i can help cool this mattress down until then? I've been sleeping with a fan, but that hasn't always worked. I've heard a Talalay Latex Mattress pad can help, others have suggested a Slumber Cloud Nacreous Mattress Pad. Are there any other suggestions that could help me sleep a little cooler at night?"

As for local mattress manufacturers - where do you find THOSE?

I love the idea of getting a mattress from costco because of their customer service and return policy, however I need some advice on their options. I know that costco mattresses tend to be made with budget in mind, so there have been reports of certain items like the casper, beautyrest, and stearns breaking down over a pretty short time frame. 

I am stuck between the two mattresses I am considering. I have heard nothing but great things about the Novaform, however I tried a similar Stearns at mattress firm months ago and loved it (althought I know they arent going to be exactly the same).

"Hybrid Recommendations for Side and Stomach Sleepers. Hello all!

My wife and I are looking to purchase a new bed. My wife ( 5'2 hot sleeper) is a stomach sleeper and I (5'9 hot sleeper) am a side/stomach sleeper. We came to the conclusion that our current bed is give us back pains and hip issues. Our current bed is a ""Cheswick Manor"" that we had for about 3-4 years already and had to replace it already due to sagging. After replacing it, it's starting sag again in the middle.

We were looking at beds before all this COVID-19 all happen, but couldn't find one. We REALLY liked the Tempur-pedic PRObreeze medium-firm hybrid mattress, but that's WAY out of our budget. We tried Purple, but I did not like the feel of that bed and heard bad things about them.

We are trying to not make the same mistake as last time. We decided that we like medium-firm hybrid mattresses. Our budget is under $2,000 (closer to $1,000 is better for us) and were looking for a King size.

I should also note, we live in the US and on the East Coast. Also, we won't be able to try out new beds in-store since our state is pretty much on lockdown.

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance."
"Trying to renew my mattress. I have a Sealy Posturepedic mattress. I believe the specific model is Lakehurst, though I'm not sure that matters. I bought it November 2013, so 6 years and a half years ago.

As would be expected, after a few years it started to show some signs of wear with digs and whathaveyou. 

So we've been looking at buying a new mattress and weighing the options. At first I was pretty excited about some of the bed in a box options out there, they're so cheap. But I read up on them and most of the cheaper ones are expected to fail in the short term, especially for a heavier person. So I started looking at more appropriately spec'd mattresses and the numbers went up really fast. 

But then I found this subreddit and someone mentioned diymattress.net. Soon I had watched a half dozen YouTube videos on building my own mattress. I told my wife about all of this and at first she was really apprehensive, why wouldn't she be? Then I showed her some videos, [including one that features the very mattress we have.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri2v0eShDHY) She was convinced.

Now I am here seeking advice. I want to stay as cheap as I can without compromise. Ideally I want to spend less than the $900 I originally spent on my Sealy but really I'm willing to spend what it takes.

Facts:

* I am 260 lbs, 5'8"" male, side sleeper
* Wife is 95lbs, 5'1"" female, stomach and side sleeper

My 'build':

* 2"" Medium firm latex
* 3"" firm latex
* Sealy pocket coil base
* 13"" cover of some kind

We have never slept on latex before (and during this pandemic we won't be stepping out to try it), but its longevity as well as cooling are really attractive to me. I've thought about changing out the topper for memory foam, since it can be really cheap, but I know it traps heat. Please let me know your thoughts."
"Soft mattresses on a budget?. So I'm looking for a relatively soft mattress for hopefully under $350CAD (Twin XL, Double/Full or Queen)

It was listed as ""Medium Firm"" but it didn't feel firm at all, compared to other mattresses they had anyways. 

I would be getting that mattress but their delivery wait time is 7 weeks. lol

"I'm at a loss here. I've had a casper since October of last year. Overtime I've just hated the sagging feeling it gave me, so I decided to flip it over, and that seemed to help alot with that. But every since I've had this mattress, I cant find a good position to sleep in. Either my head is too low and it hurts my shoulder the next morning, or my head is too high and the hips dig into the mattress. I have no idea what to do I've been adjusting pillows for months. Should I just get a new mattress? Sleep on the floor? I'm dying here."
"Foam mattress recommendation for heavy people?. Before we were quarantined and everything closed, my wife and I began mattress shopping.  We discovered that a foam mattress would probably be best for the two of us, because she's an incredibly light sleeper who wakes whenever I shift. No motion transfer is a must.

We both weigh in the 220-240 pounds range, and we're in the US.

I've reviewed the options out there for heavier people - The Helix Plus, Winkbed Plus,  Big Fig, Saatva HD, and Titan, and only the Helix Plus is a memory foam bed, the rest are hybrids. 

Should we just bite on the Helix Plus, or do you know if any of the others have no motion transfer?  I love the idea of getting a latex bed if it will last longer, but how is motion transfer on a firm latex bed?

Thanks so much. I'm tearing my hair out over here."

Our budget ceiling is $2800. I think we'd both prefer something sort of in the middle. Not super firm, but not in the super soft range (I know, wonderful description).

I'm pretty zerod in on the Big Fig and the foundation it comes with. Is this a mistake? Should I go for a WinkBed or something instead? I need long term support to sleep on my stomach. This is a big purchase for me and I'll be stuck with it for probably 10 years."
"Brentwood, Brooklyn, or T&N?. So looking to replace my 10+ year old innerspring. After going away for a couple weeks and sleeping on a hybrid, I realized just how bad my bed is. Coming home the first night and sleeping on it I had lower back pain the next and have had it every day since. 

I am generally a back and side sleeper so I think a medium/medium-soft bed would work best for me. 

My budget  is under $1000 (really closer to $800 though). Right now I'm looking at a [Brentwood Home Cyprus Luxe Hybrid](https://www.brentwoodhome.com/products/cypress-memory-foam-mattress?variant=31224937611326), a [Brooklyn Signature Hybrid](https://www.brooklynbedding.com/products/mattresses/brooklyn-signature/?utm_source=shareasale.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1242889&sscid=41k4_a64qu) in medium, or possibly a [Tuft and Needle Hybrid](https://www.tuftandneedle.com/mattress/hybrid/).

Being this is my first mattress purchase in a while I'm not sure exactly which to get. Wondering if anyone with experience of any of these beds/companies could chime in and give your opinions or point me in the right direction."
"Leewadee or Shikibuton pro and cons?. Hey I’m hoping to find anyone who has any experience with both. I’m trying to figure out which one would be the better choice for me to sleep on on the floor. I like that both don’t take up space since you can store them away. The Shikibuton being light so I can hang it outside in the sun every now and then, and it might last longer with a tatami mat too. I like the leewadee because it’s pretty, thick and I’m Thai lol so I might feel a bit obligated towards it lol. But what I’m thinking is, if I sleep on it daily, how to make sure it stays clean and then the risk of it maybe breaking as read on some reviews on Amazon. 

Hope anyone can give me some thoughts lol"
"I am looking to purchase a softer mattress than the Leesa I currently own, but I live in Germany and not familiar with many brands. Any advice?. My wife weighs about 45kgs (99lbs) and I weigh about 72kg (158lbs) and we have owned the Leesa for a year. Recently, the mattress has been giving us major issues with our shoulders from side sleeping. I believe the mattress is definitely too firm for my wife so I’m looking for alternatives for her. Right now we are sleeping at her moms house and Joop! spring mattresses and it’s great for her.

What are some recommended mattresses that are softer? I’m willing to spend up to 2000€ for one."
"What I learned: My latex mattress choice. I just spent days and an embarrassing amount of hours thinking and researching about mattresses. I'm thankful to this community for the help so I'd like to give back by sharing my experience and choices.

WHY I TURNED AWAY FROM NON-LATEX FOAM

Originally liked the idea of lots of layers. I like memory foam but it's a little intense so I think an underlayer of it would be valuable. But I learned that chemicals in it release gases that may be harmful. Plenty of companies offer foams that have a PER-US (? Something like that) certification. I saw somewhere that this certification is to help US manufacturers beat foreign ones. But it may also churn out safe foam. But it does not eradicate the off-gassing chemicals (VOCs), just minimizes. 

I am not sure I would care about this if it weren't for my breathing issues (asthma and other). I'm very sensitive and don't want to let some material slowly make me worse without my knowing. Don't want to risk it. If it weren't for my health issues, I think I would take the ""risks."" 

Another reason to avoid non-latex foams is they sleep warm. I'm pretty sure all non-latex foams are polyurethane products. Petroleum products. It's not surprising that they trap heat. All petroleum products do, like polyester. Plastics are great insulators. Although many of these companies advertise cooling methods. I have faith in my fellow engineers that these methods might work wonders. I didn't look deep into this bc I was already turning away from non-latex foams for off-gassing health concerns. Make sure yours has a reputable cooling method if you get non-latex foam!!! (Look at reviews.)

IF you want to avoid these foams, you need to look closely. They are everywhere. Look at what each mattress is made of, all layers. If it says a layer that isn't a material you explicitly know of, it's probably an off-gassing-type foam (even if it is very reduced, ie, no smell). All memory foams are. If it has weird stuff to absorb the smell like free tea or charcoal or whatever, it has those gases.. Plenty of mattresses are called latex or natural or whatever and then you look closer and they have a ""comfort foam."" If that comfort foam was latex, they would call it latex because they'd be proud that it is. So be careful.

WHY I LIKE LATEX

Saying I like it is strong. I just ordered it and it's Rona season so I haven't touched any new mattresses. But I like what I learned on the web.

Latex is naturally good for my health issues. Mattresses, especially the old kind, are famous for storing dust and mildew and such. This is bad for anyone's health and that's why it's important to change your mattress out. Latex breathes (unlike poly foam products). This keeps moisture and mildew out. It's naturally antimicrobial which wows me. Read up, there's lots of details out there on this.

Latex doesn't act so aggressive in hugging your body like memory foam does. I prefer that. Talalay latex should be as soft but also but bounces back instead of trapping you in one spot.

WHY I TURNED FROM HYBRID TO ALL FOAM

At first I wanted hybrid, which has foam and springs. They should be cheaper. But I heard the coils are stiffer for hybrids. I'm a side sleeper and heard its better to go all foam for me. Additionally, I found ways to save money by buying layers separately and searching endlessly.

Also, affordable hybrids didn't have enough foam layers. Also alot didn't have adjustable firmness. I wanted more flexibility (ha). But I'd have been happy with a well cushioned hybrid. It just felt more of a gamble

WHAT LAYERS I CHOSE

I'm a small, light person (110#, 5'2) and side sleeper. I was recommended plush firmness for the comfort layer and medium for the support layer. I generally don't like mattresses to be too soft, but latex is bouncy and so I shouldn't sink in like memory foam, I hope. My husband is a bigger than me (5'10, 155#) and he sleeps on his stomach or back. Because of these things, he needs more support. With a plush top, he would sink in the top layer awkwardly. Medium should be good for his top layer. Both of us will have a medium support layer because we aren't very heavy and don't want a firm mattress.

I value the properties of talalay and Dunlop latex. Talalay is supposed to be very soft (but varies in firmness). It doesn't last as long but it's high quality and good for a Top layer. Typical choice for vendors. Dunlop latex is typically stronger And more firm. For this reason it's used as a support layer. It's supposed to be more durable and long lasting. 

We chose a 6"" Dunlop support layer, medium firmness. And a 3"" talalay comfort layer, varying firmness. My side is plush and my husband's side is firm. To do two different types, they take two different sheets of foam and glue them together.

WHO I BOUGHT FROM

All for a queen bed:
I search allloottt for the best deal I could find for good quality. I narrowed down to list of companies with good reputations and good prices. I didn't want to spend more than $1000 and was aiming for $600-$800. I couldn't find exactly what I wanted in my price range from any one vendor. I wanted to choose my firmnesses directly. FYI, some vendors sell DIY mattresses and you buy each piece separately. This tends to cost more and they remove some perks of buying a full mattress.. Shipping and return policies become less friendly. This was important to me because I'm buying during Rona and want to have the chance to change my mind. And shipping is alot for latex bc latex is really heavy. 

So I got the 3"" talalay topper (comfort layer) from SleepEZ for $371. I also bought a $76 cotton cover for it to protect it. Especially since talalay is less durable. To vary the firmness, I commented what I want during checkout. This is what they told me to do when I called. Great customer service. I would have also bought this from Latex Mattress Factory as their prices were the same. I called SleepEZ first bc I suspected they'd let me choose the different firmnesses. They were so kind and they said yes. So I had no inclination to call the other. Also, could have saved $# by getting a 2"" or no cover. Just decided to spend the extra on it.

I got the support layer, a 6"" Dunlop base, from Sleep On Latex. Medium firmness. It's a rare thing to find 6"" slab of Dunlop sold alone. This was technically a mattress they had where I choose the ""low profile"" version for $595. Since this is one of their mattresses, it comes with a cover. Great customer service as well.

My grand total was about $1040 before tax. This was slightly more than I wanted to spend, but it's exactly what I wanted for the cheapest price I could find. 

(Please don't tell me if you think I made the wrong choices. I'm hear to share my knowledge and opinions gained, not asking advice. Already bought it and tired of thinking about it.)"

"First-time online buyer, way overwhelmed. Help?. Hello mattress experts,

I can't tell if what I'm looking for is simply hidden or just doesn't exist. I'm hoping to find something in the $700-900, but that could be stretched a bit if absolutely needed. Here are the things I want:

- Queen
- Firm
- Innerspring (or hybrid)
- No pillow top

The problem I keep running into is that every innerspring mattress in this price range is either poorly reviewed or has a pillow top. I tried looking into hybrids, but they either weren't firm enough or were too expensive. I'd consider memory foam, but I'm extremely dubious about finding one that's at all firm.

And obviously the bigger problem is that I can't really go into a store right now, so I'm stuck buying online. Any suggestions?"
"Got an 'Extra Firm' MF Mattress and disappointed. Advice? UK. Long ago I stayed at a resort in the Maldives, and they used a bed which was so hard as to be shocking. It was made locally and seemingly of brushwood or the like, because aside from an inch of give over the top, it was like sleeping on a Klingon shelf from Star Trek.

I'm a back sleeper: It was tough to get used to in the night, but when I got up the next day I thought something had gone wrong. The problem? *No lower back pain*! My coccyx which is always trying to escape behind me was in place! It was a really novel feeling.

Skip forward a few years and I'm finally in a position to get a mattress for myself. [I bought this 'Extra Firm' '5/5 hardness' one last week](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Naturalex-EXTRAFRESH-150x200cm-Microcapsules-Oeko-tex%C2%AE/dp/B07N84L5LF/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=extra%2Bfirm%2Bmattress&qid=1588502953&sr=8-3&th=1&psc=1) and I have to say I'm disappointed: my sacrum is still digging a hole for itself and making me wake up aching. Less so than the previous thin soft memory foam one I was using, but it hasn't been the panacea for which I'd hoped.

I think it's memory foam acting as it's supposed to: as it heats up, it softens. I'm not a big guy, around 75kg, so it's not a weight issue just a funky lumbar curve.

Do you have any advice on finding a truly rock-hard sleeping surface? I wonder if I can return this one."
"Frame Style for a DIY Latex Hybrid Mattress. I’m slowly in the process of buying materials for a diy latex mattress. I’ve bought all of the toppers for my comfort layers (from sleeponlatex) and at this point I just need to buy the pocket coils and zippered cover (I’m going with the organic wool cover and 8 inch combi-zoned coils from diymattress.net.) Right now my current bed is sitting on a box spring which I know would damage the pocket coils so I realized that I need to buy a new frame before I complete the mattress. 

I bought this 14 inch high budget frame from Zinus and would like advice as to if this will be sufficient for my mattress build: 

https://www.zinus.com/products/suzanne-platforma-bed-frame

If it is not I’m considering buying a 1 inch layer of high density polyfoam from thefoamfactory.com or maybe even a firm latex topper from sleeponlatex to have as a base layer underneath the pocket coils as support. Would this be necessary/acceptable, or will the wooden slats be ok enough to not damage my coils?

Thanks for any and all advice!"

"Need help choosing adjustable base and mattress. I'm looking between Leggett and Platt Prodigy 2 and Sven & Son Split King. 

Must haves: 

1. Split king: I'm a side sleeper, wife is a back sleeper (9 months pregnant ATM)
2. Wall hugger

Nice to haves: 

1. USB charging
2. Head tilt (is it that cool?)
3. Storage option

As for the mattress, we both have a prefered firmness of  8-9 on a 10 point scale, we run hot, I'm 6'0 and about 245#, wife is 5'9' and would murder me if I called out her weight on here, so the mystery continues. 

I assume Twin XL's will be par for the course.

Budget: Obviously I don't want to overspend. But based on a cursory look, \~1.7k for the base, and roughly \~1k for each twin xl mattress.

"Looking for something similar to this Serta mattress but can't find it online. So I slept on a relatives mattress at some point and it was way more comfortable than my current one. My current mattress is an 7 yld side coil mattress that isn't very good and is sunken in and uncomfortable.

The bed I slept on was a Serta mattress that I believe is memory foam. This bed was also 7 yld so I doubt I'll be able to find the exact model but I want something similar at least, brand doesn't matter. I have a picture of the tag, but I looked every number on it up online and couldn't find anything.

"Shopping in Canada - heavy (260 lbs) side sleeper. I really need a good mattress.  For the past four years I have tried two different mattresses.  I first bought the original Purple, and while it was good, I felt it wasn't as good as I wanted it to be for the price I paid.  
Then I returned it and got an Endy - a bunch of friends were buying them and were raving, and everything I read was good.  NOPE.  Tons of lower back pain and stiffness.  It's too firm.

I'm now at the point where I NEED to get rid of it and find a new mattress.  I'll get another Purple if I have to (really sad the new hybrids don't ship to Canada), but I'd rather find something that will actually let me get a really good solid nights sleep with as little pain as possible (I actually sleep pretty well for 4-6 hours on the Endy, but then my back starts getting sore and I wake up).

So, looking for help.  I've read like every sleep blog on the web, but the mattresses I've fallen in love with (like Layla) are going to be REALLY expensive to ship + exchange rate.  Pretty sure I'm looking for something on the softer side given Endy is pretty squarely in the middle (high 5 or 6) on the firm/soft scale.

So, if anyone can help, I'd be greatly appreciative."
"Need a memory foam or hybrid...I think.... Hi there! You all seem pretty knowledgeable, so I’m asking for help. 

The Mr. and I bought a very expensive pillow top mattress about 5 years ago. From the beginning, we weren’t sure it was as good as the one in the store, but by the time we really decided that we hated it, it was past the return. 

We’re waking up in pain daily now. 

I loved our old Tempurpedic, but he didn’t. That said, he travels half of the year, so he said to try and find the best one for my back (I have scoliosis and an old neck injury). 

I am a stomach sleeper, and he’s all over creation. ??

"Slatted bunky board?. I recently bought an innerspring mattress from MF, and they said my slatted frame could cause damage to the mattress and would void the warranty. They threw in a bunky board with our order (well, two twins to match the footprint of our king).

Just today, when rotating the mattress, I noticed that the board isn't a board at all, but is itself slatted, a skeleton of wood beams, all wrapped in gray cloth. These beams are sturdier than my frame's slats, but are also much farther apart from each other: the bunky slats have 8.5-inch gaps between them compared to the 3 inches gaps between the frame's slats. As a result, it seems the weight of the mattress is being supported from below by much less surface area against the mattress, which it seems would put more pressure on specific places.

Is this actually a bunky board, and is it actually better than the slats underneath? Could this possibly account for recent back problems I've had, where it feels like the mattress dips under my hips? If I switched to a latex mattress, would I have to get an actual solid board to support it?"
